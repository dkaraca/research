233,less than hours,0
234,however if you want a what could be improved in later models list a x resolution would be welcomed while gb of ram gets the job done it would be nice to see gb an inch screen could easily fit in the same overall space and would make this an even better comparable to small laptops better battery life would always be welcome a second full usb port on the other side of the keyboard would largely improve the laptop utility,1

284,this time i spent probably hours clicking everything i could read ebook online nothing hopfully the seller will give me all my money back,0
285,i wont buy for this purpose but it would be great for web surfing as long as you dont need to save or download anything,1
286,lastly six hours of battery life my foot,0
287,the sticker on the back of the computer is just blackish grey,0
288,since both are google products theres no excuse for this,0
290,i did not get a chance to test unplugged gaming time but i would assume it would be around hour or less,0
291,i originally thought it would be neat to have a solid state drive for fast start times and touch screen cool factor in my work computer which does primarily excel work and coding,1
292,one month out of warranty and i now have a operating system damaged or missing message at startup,0
293,this asus unit is at the login screen after booting within seconds or less,0
294,there are some limitations of living inside the chrome world but they are less and less every year,0
295,above alli cherish this purchase experience and the laptopwhich will accompany my next years college life,0
296,i purchased this item for my daughter for her birthday less than a year ago and as of last month the volume is not working correctly,0
297,they called within a week and said that the damaged was caused by the consumer not a flaw in the computer and they could fix it for unreal as we paid less that for the computer,0
298,while not an essential part of any laptop it would be nice if i could see the keys better at night,1
299,just after the warranty expired the display went out and it can not be repaired for less than the cost of the computer so in the trash it goes,0
300,one for system one for recovery one for the os programs and lastly a th for user data,0
301,its missing the sd card slot and there is a lot of damage to the structure itself,0
302,did not come with shrink wrap over the screen as my last one did and that one was listed as an amazon warehouse deal refurbished one,0
303,turned out it was this specific laptops onoff wireless switch that needed to be manually turned back on,0
304,and the customer support in china tell me it usually last hours depending on how you use it,0
305,what i received was last years model third generation in the same computer,0
306,less than a year and i have to take it in for the connection between the keyboard and the screen,0
307,hardware this thing is a fingerprint magnet both outside and inside,0
308,less than one year and i had to change the screen and battery,0
309,the battery life is the biggest failing since during regular use this laptop seems to last around two hours on battery,0
310,five stars for pricefeature value less some for the lack of keyboard indicator lights and optical drive opener problem,0
311,stated for hours i get less than hours,0
312,because it doesnt have a solid state drive in it windows ten does play nicer with it,0
313,then the problems started and asus tech support and warranty repair turned out to be a hollow shell,0
314,this way he if he doesnt need the weight or power of his macbook he can just use this out and about or for social media stuff while were watching tv,0
315,it would be nice to have the number pad but it would take up way too much space and would not be feasible on the air,1
316,less than days later the screen started having colored line across it,0
317,secondly i wanted something that would last some hours before needing to be recharged,0
318,likewise this apu with all of its integrated graphics capabilities feels like a big waste of silicon and transistors that cant be utilized when the tdp is limited to watts,0
319,ive used dell latitude laptops that always include a standard year warranty and they are solidly built and refuse to die except for the batteries that need replacing,0
320,advertising a hour battery life and delivering less than a third of that,0
321,but after a couple calls with technical support they took the computer back and are replacing it,0
322,we looked up warranty info and it appears its serviced outside the us,0
323,this is my th chromebook and nd from samsung that ive purchased in the last years,0
324,the readwrite is a lot faster and what that means for you is less twirling beach balls and speedier application launching and file saving,0
325,within that same hour i put it back in its box and i returned it and got my money back,0
326,the second biggest problem is the ssd solid state drive,0
327,once the laptop was sent in dell informed that the screen damage was customer induced and wants to charge canadian dollars a third of the cost of the laptop,0
328,when i bought it i did not realize that it was not windows based and i find it wont run any of the programs i use regularly,0
329,by day i started receiving a drive error message no less than times a day,0
330,the battery seems to last just under four hours,0
331,i purchased this laptop after watching lon seidmans review of this product and subsequent review of this product on here,0
332,if used continuously it can last for about five to six hours,0
333,i bought this computer when my last one stopped working,0
334,i like the tb and ram because i have thousands of photos and videos that i regularly take and access,0
335,i feel like the navy one looks like a macbook dupe overall super impressed and hopefully the battery lasts a long time i bought this for college needs,1
336,it would be so nice to have a way to access them without going through any workarounds but no google didnt support its own program on this otherwise delightful little netbook,1
337,the last one that i bought was another brand,0
338,also weights less than lbs,0
339,they work technically they work but its hit or miss in terms of does an app properly support tablet mode or is it a phone app stretched across the screen,0
340,sd cards inserted into the laptops card reader do not sit flush to the unit making carrying additional storage less convenient,0
341,if you want to save a bit of cash go with the regular non pro series and just lose mbps write speed and save,0
342,love the color its a transparency color hopefully it can support my essays,1
343,comparable to the njk accept this one has no cd drive and the cpu has less threads njk has this one has but this is also a lot thinner and lighter then the n,0
344,lastly theres no cddvd slot,0
345,the battery does seem to last about house and charges in a flash,0
346,the battery is also internal and must be replaced the same way,0
347,i would warn anyone purchasing any asus computers that they do not last,0
348,that computer is retired no faster than this asus and less than hours on a charge,0
349,with less than dollars i give stars to this hp model,0
350,thought it was a regular computer,0
351,bought this device used it for less than a week and now it wont power on,0
352,my last computer a dell lasted for years,0
353,it doesnt have all the bells whistles of other laptops on the market but for the price quality i hope this lasts for quite some time,1
354,it would be a great laptop if it worked or the company actually provided service,1
355,i purchased mine from walmart in my city for less than i could get it online but its worth the price i see it advertised on amazon or anywhere else,0
356,i wanted to run linux on it figured it would be no big deal but it uses a bit uefi boot loader on a bit cpu architecture which is ridiculous to try and change the operating system since there is virtually no linux distros that support it its also running a bit version of windows why have a bit cpu and put a bit os on it the only way to boot linux is to get ahold of a bit uefi boot loader put in the efiboot folder on your install medium then when it freezes on a command line while booting cd into the drivers,1
357,battery can last for several hours as advised but that number gets reduced if you use it on maximum performance mode of course,0
358,my only worry is that this freezing thing will get worse at the year mark but im trying my best to treat it well and hopefully this computer can last at least years,1
359,i purchased the extended year warranty for added piece of mind but hopefully i wont need to use it,1
360,never the less it could be but i have properly working laptop that has fallen apart from its monitor and can not be put back no matter what,0
361,i setup my chromebook to allow my family members to login as regular users,0
362,might be the last considering the support,0
363,they agreed to fix the computer but i would be without the computer for about weeks including ship time there and back and actual repair time,0
364,i hope that this laptop can last a couple of years,0
365,well according to wikipedia in computing a trim command allows an operating system to inform a solid state drive ssd which blocks of data are no longer considered in use and can be wiped internally,0
366,avg uses much less cpu when sitting idle,0
367,i am a mac person for the last years,0
368,im hoping this will last me years like my macbook did,0
369,with the lower portion of the ports sitting outside of the case,0
370,this is the second chromebook for my house and not the last my next computer will be another chromebook or a chromebox,0
371,a few things to note there is no optical drive youll need to use an external drive or download your software from the net,0
372,until last night id have given this computer stars,0
373,now less than years later the cover is coming apart,0
374,with gaming and designing i could barely last hours,0
375,a few days later i called asus sustomer support and filed a rma form,0
376,i had to buy an external drive though later on i had thought i would not need it but i do for the work i doing with it,0
377,in the last years ive gone through solid state drives,0
378,updated with this model a few years later and what,0
379,my problem is that the warranty shows starting in june and expiring in less than months,0
380,i installed it in less than a minute and required no dismantling of the laptop,0
381,probably rolling back the driver to the previous update or waiting for a fix by asus is the solution,0
382,also i found this machine on sale today at dell and frys for less than while at couple of online stores i note the price at over,0
383,i tried to back it up to a proper gb flash drive and the screen immediately started flashing on and off,0
384,theres a function in windows settings that lets you see what appsprocesses are draining the battery over the last hours,0
385,didnt even last hours before the screen went out,0
386,the screen is a victim of getting the price to where it is,0
387,for me im much less productive as a result,0
388,i wish the ac power adapter had prongs that stowed away for when carrying this in a bag,1
389,i would think that paying this price for a computer it would last longer than months,0
390,com and found windows pro oem for th of the regular price legit and verified but use paypal,0
391,i thought id be buying something that id have for a few years but less than a year in im having a lot of problems with it,0
392,maybe im the april fool to keep trying but number four about p m last night i unboxed number four,0
393,battery realistically will last hours with wifi and internet surfing instead of the hrs advertised,0
394,but it would be nice if the build quality would at hold up for a year,1
395,the chromebook will say it has hours left and a few minutes later it dies,0
396,i am done whp products nothing is designed to last beyond years and ive bought from the highest end to the cheaper,0
397,had it less than hours,0
398,i been waiting to get one since last year,0
399,consi did have issues with wifi dropping about times but i updated the drivers and fingers crossed no issues for the last week,0
400,its a bit slower than my wifes regular computer but it gets the job done,0
401,hopefully the machine will last i do see that some people have issues crop up after a few months of use but type any computer manufactures followed by the words problems or issue and you will get billions of hits it comes with the program,0
402,yes it would be nice if the screen was higher resolution but for most of what i want to use it for and for the money this is a great deal,1
403,what i got was just a blue screen not on or off i shut it off and put it back on,0
404,how i came to buy this computer a few weeks ago i spilled water next to my macbook pro and fried the logic board,0
405,this is third computer from amazon and from hsn that i have purchased in the last few weeks,0
406,thank you amazon for taking it back im looking forward to another computer of another brand one which actually has customer service,0
407,i contacted google regarding the problems and after several attempts to get it going properly the google rep concluded the device needed to have the version of the google operating system updated,0
408,i have used it regularly each day as a second computer to the tabletop we keep in our office,0
409,so you have to make a judgement call but it would be great if you could have some hard data to help,1
411,it lost the driver to the internet overheated the screen flashed darklight all in less than two weeks of receiving the product,0
412,i cant remember the last time i even used a software program,0
413,i got this computer last month for school,0
414,this is the last asus product i will ever buy and the last time i will use the microsoft store to purchase hardware,0
415,i have a regular drive for documents and everything else,0
416,performance it does crash once in a while but less after system updates,0
417,hopefully asus improves the battery to last about to hours in future models of this laptop,0
418,as for internal memory remember you have a usb a usb a sd card slot and a regular size hdmi port,0
419,last years display was criticized for being a pentile display and for its yellowish hue,0
420,they could have also made it user replaceable like companies have been doing for the last decade,0
421,i havent owned one before but i have owned several desktops as well as a few laptops and macbook pros over the course of the last years,0
423,there is no way to configure the keyboards backlight outside of shutting it of turning it on or off there is no way to change the brightness level or set it to always on this is not a huge issue but it would be nice to be able to stop the keyboard backlight from shutting off after seconds of the last keystroke,1
424,lastly here are the disk performance results for the internal gb ssd storage,0
425,turns out i didnt buy it from amazon i bought it from casol electronicsand casol is not an authorized dealer of viziothereforeno warranty to boot i was outside of the day amazon electronics return so no help there eitheruntil i logged into an amazon chat dialog,0
426,makes the machine less portable,0
427,the last laptop i bought was over eight years ago,0
428,the last person was a reviewer who bought this model is using it and took the time to answer my questions on amazon,0
429,its battery last hours,0
430,now i have to purchase another laptop locally at twice the actual price just so that i can give these gifts on time,0
431,ive had this laptop for less than a year and about months ago it started crashing on me,0
432,in all fairness asus offered me a less than generous price deduction on my replacement laptop,0
433,if you push the power button the desktop will be up in seconds or less,0
434,its been plugged into the ac for days now but every time i unplug it the battery dies in less than seconds,0
435,it would be nice if the charging method was through micro usb like for phones or the option to use it as a charger,1
436,there are no authorized service centers outside of the factory so the computer needs to be shipped back to china for servicing,0
437,if there is a better laptop at or below the price point i would love to see it,1
438,my last were comparable models of this one,0
439,guess what if i have problem with my apple macbook pro i drive to the local apple store where their eager apple helpers actually do assist in resolving any issue i have,0
440,my one dvd player was on its last year of warranty and it just quit,0
441,i have no programs on it ive deleted all the apps it came with and still i have less than gb remaining on the disc,0
442,i bought this for my son for christmas it worked less than hours,0
443,the battery being used on level brightness while running word excel ie and spss tends to last about hours,0
444,the big problems i have with it are the trackpad and screen resolution though i wont take the latter into consideration with this review because im not too well informed about it and ive been informed that there may be some way to remedy this,0
445,ive had it for less than months and the usb port dont work,0
446,the actual screen on the is almost less,0
447,yes the battery will not last longer than about hrs but neither would my sp,0
448,i have used this machine in conjunction with a targus usb docking station for the last month or so,0
449,weve had our chromebook for over years now and our children use them regularly work school work and khan academy,0
450,the name itself makes me jiggle intel i quad core unibody action the overall look and feel of this laptop is solid,0
451,ive had an hp laptop last for years an asus last for toshiba for,0
452,missing i i tried to research processors before i purchased a computer,0
453,i would expect this notebook to last for to years but the battery probably will die before then,0
454,none the less the cons still feel like cons because carrying extra items makes the laptop mobility feel less mobile and therefore less convenient,0
455,this computer although it has less memory the solid state drive makes up the difference,0
456,it doesnt have the same beauty as a mac but at the price they are selling this one at i couldnt care less,0
457,it seems to change the date at about pm waking the computer from sleep to do so and usually does it multiple times if you keep putting the computer back to sleep otherwise it will just change it,0
458,and my local fixit shop says they can not recover data from a solid state drive,0
459,the last dell inspiron lasted me years until the mother board fried and then i bought this one,0
460,the system seems to hesitate every few minutes for anywhere from seconds to several minutes,0
461,the last time i installed this for a client it took almost two hours to install onto a samsung ssd not nvme on a dell xps with an intel k and gb ddr ram,0
462,look up acer they have one with gb drive and gb of ram for less than,0
463,i bought a gb micro sd card and on ebay a sdusb adapter for the micro sd card less than,0
464,it would be great if googleasus let their customers know when updates were ready for channels on the device a notification like on an android device would be nice,1
465,prior to this laptop i had hp laptop for few years then toshiba laptop for few years and then again hp laptop for few years,0
466,i wish the laptop was less and just didnt bother to come with ram or hdd,0
467,my last hp lasted me years,0
468,however until the last month google had planned to support this model but had not yet gotten around to it,0
469,i might update the review later with pictures and an actual benchmark of battery life,0
470,they are not separate independent buttons like im used to and they are harder to press and make a louder click than my previous laptop dell vostro v,0
471,the previous c had standard sized slots but im guessing the thinness of the c necessitated the use of micro sized inputs,0
472,gtx strix graphics card came with faulty pre applied thermal paste and missing thermal pads from the gddrx memory modules,0
473,the keyboard is standard to pcs with blue back lighting which is helpful for night usage,0
474,edit missing drive parts arrived today one week after purchase,0
475,i got this product today and have spent the last couple hours playing around with it,0
476,the battery still runs on hours doing regular web surfing,0
477,i use mine for standard college student tasks but it can run some solid programs if needed,0
478,also the screen quality is horrendous but since it can be upgraded i can excuse this what i cant excuse is the scaling required to stop everything from appearing blurry,0
479,i think it would be a great computer if it worked,1
480,overall i would say this is a solid purchase for someone who has basic computer needs,0
482,it would be great fro a year old but no one else that needs to work on anything for real,1
483,anyways i find that it makes the user experience considerably less transparent documentationinstructions on included hardwaresoftware is non existent with the laptop,0
484,and not too loaded with bloatware tho there were a lot of acer specific programs that didnt seem particularly useful,0
485,i transitioned from dell pcs last year to an imac and have not looked back since,0
486,the second reason is the hardware specs that are already listed above,0
487,hours lasts way longer than what i need and it will usually last me about days of school work,0
488,ive had a couple of macsmacbooks in the last years and heres my review of the inch mba ultra portable,0
489,once the computer was closed and reopened the screen would appear to be blank,0
490,ive taken it to work to use for training and subsequently decided to outfit our school computer lab with this model,0
491,i have had an iphone and ipad for the last several years,0
492,i just received the computer back from repairs and it worked for about days and the same problem started happening again,0
493,so i went back to charging and had to reinstall a few programs,0
494,in power saving mode it can easily last hrs,0
495,defective product could not use had to send back big hassle,0
496,the double tap drag functionality is unreliable and requires precision on your part,0
497,i initially had a tablet with a wireless keyboard but it was an android device and wasnt compatible with a few programs i need for work,0
498,it has three regular usb ports so i can have my wireless mouse and keyboard hooked up a flash drive and a hdd with no problem,0
499,i made the mistake of not calibrating my colors properly hopefully you wont do the same,1
500,i bet theyd be helpful if i wanted those but i would be worried about what it would cost after a year i hope this unit lasts more than a year,1
501,its all soldered on and solid state and led backlit so it should last a lifetime,0
502,it also has a regular sd card slot so i can download pictures from my camera,0
503,fingers crossed that the automatic updates will solve these problems last point i want to critisize is that loads of programs are not compatible yet with chrome os,0
504,after about days worth of back and forth they told me that it is a hardware problem which is what i was saying from day one,0
505,but that would also cost me about with tax and it would be nice to have a more natural way to access the windows world rather then the unwieldy bootcamp option,1
506,all and all they are simple devices but it would be nice to have a more immediate access to deep config settings,1
507,within less than months the battery on this computer is not holding charge,0
508,some one with less patience would have re installed the o s and started over,0
509,but i have owned a lot of computers over the last twenty years and i make a living working with computers and i have never seen this happen anywhere before,0
510,i wish the screen hinge had more range of motion and it needs a keyboard lightbacklight other than that and the fact that win blows works perfectly,1
511,i didnt know this till i jarred my laptop when i went to turn it on the drive was missing,0
512,there are some differences from a regular computer but nothing that is an issue for me,0
513,if you plan on using it to produce the few things that it can produce like type an essay then this can be useful without an internet connection,0
514,secondly i went to their customer support web site and downloaded the operations manual for my specific machine,0
515,i have used lenovo computers for the last several years was a big fan,0
516,overall this laptop is going to last you a year before its practically unusable,0
517,will give to my husband to take notes at school big waste of money,0
518,then the computer will be properly turned off till the next day to use for a another hour and a half,0
519,my last chromebook cost years ago,0
520,i had it less the one month and had to return it because the letters i and k stuck and the number would not work,0
521,less cost i use it for online surfing and i have had zero problems running windows programs office adobe,0
522,this did not last year,0
523,chrome os offers the easiest maintenance model of desktop operating systems setting up upgrading protecting back uping or updating require much less time and skill,0
524,with a netbook or regular laptop you can still do work you can access your harddrive and you dont have to rely on the cloud which is now inaccessible under circumstances like i mentioned,0
525,it would be nice if they included a to drive bay adapter,1
526,i bought this one as a replacement november so less than a year ago,0
527,turns out the wifi card was either missing or not properly installed,0
528,every attempt i made to use the pen that come with system was stymied by less than functional sw as i couldnt find a way to covert writing to text which is all i would use it for so losing the touch scree isnt that big a deal,0
529,i bought it cyber monday of last year,0
530,but the laptop burned months later to request a warranty repairs hp asked me to send the laptop back to united states they refuse to repair this computer outside us,0
531,for the last three years my group has purchased all seniors netbooks to aid them with college and financial aid applications,0
532,then white screen blue circle,0
533,lenovo used to build laptops that lasted years for work but now is turning out laptops that do not last months,0
534,i hope google continues to support their line of chromebooks and hopefully adds an option for chrome users to use android apps to give chromebooks even more use in the modern worldasus c inch chromebook rockchip gb gb ssd navy blue,1
535,within weeks i can not get into the computer all i get is a screen that says boot configuration is missing,0
536,i called up lenovo technical support for this several times and after downloading the driver it got stuck at installation,0
537,i will recommend this chromebook to anyone who has already had a regular laptop windows pc or mac and want something that is portable while do a lot of editting this review is editted on this chromebook,0
538,within less than a year computer start up showed error with the fan,0
539,windows was reinstalled as a last ditch effort,0
540,it arrived via amazon delivery after less than hours,0
541,as already mentioned the battery is rated to last almost hours,0
542,you can see this if you drag a window across the screen or scroll text,0
543,in addition it has been years since i last connected a laptop to the internet via a gigabit ethernet port so that connection will not be missed,0
544,but then they did the same thing on the next product sold,0
545,i like the feel of this computer hope this will last me through the rest of my days age becomes an issue,0
546,i installed this last night,0
547,the same price listed is and the regular is around so idk whats up with that i got it for less than,0
548,it says on the details that it comeswith the regular on board intel graphics and nvidia nvs m,0
549,however when viewing pages with white backgrounds you will notice a slightly cloudy appearance to the display,0
550,the windows homepage does not display and neither does the regular screen,0
551,setup took less than three minutes all systems go,0
552,a few of the inbuilt office style apps e g mail seem like relics from the mid s,0
553,i also called amazon technical support and was told to delete my anti virus protection and if in days it continues i should send it back for a replacement or refund,0
554,after starting it i got a blank blue screen and could not do anything,0
555,on startup i saw this message appear on the screen chrome os is missing or damaged,0
556,it works everywhere i need it battery life last all day,0
557,starting in january sent it in because it wouldnt charge got it back with the backlighting on the keyboard not working sent it in again got it back and updated to a few days later the tablet function stopped working customer support helped me by directing me to restore it this resulted in me losing everything including microsoft office,0
558,but overall it gets the job done and for the price i paid this was well worth it,0
559,i upgraded ram to gb and got this beast for less than us,0
560,restarting brought me immediately back to the same error screen,0
561,sometimes will stop working while im typing and not add the letters ive typed but start back up missing them if that makes sense,0
562,missing why doesnt a mac book have a built in card reader,0
563,i in fact have for the last few months been using it as a desktop computer,0
564,cons its fairly heavy compared to similar products slow charging and i wish the screen resolution was a little bit better,1
565,i bought the asus chromebook flip to use as a lightweight laptop for regular web browsing so i wouldnt have to lug out my macbook pro,0
566,it is far more versatile than i thought it would be and i admit i have a lot to learn about it but it boots fast the screen is very nice indeed and the sound is excellent,1
567,it would be a waste of money to keep i would rather have none than waste money,1
568,one problem the battery dies in less than an hour,0
569,now i cant imagine why i carried around the beast that was my last computer,0
570,i bought the ideapad s because it was selling for less than two hundred dollars on amazon and because it had an hdmi port so i could play movies from the ideapad on my big screen hd tv,0
571,if they refresh the system this will be the third and last time that i reconfigure this machine,0
572,and of course the solid state drive means no internal moving parts except for the fan which is barely audible,0
573,it has all the spec items i was looking for and it cost about less than i was expecting to pay,0
574,i am a mac user for the last years,0
575,the processor is not very big,0
576,they will not let outside contractors work in their computers,0
577,had it less than a year and it died,0
578,my fps would be stable and then id dip down about frames for a second and then bounce back,0
579,i even installed windows last month,0
580,i have had this laptop less than months and the wireless adapter no longer works avoid avoid,0
581,of course it would be awesome to have a cd player but they are going defunct and it probably keeps it light,1
582,i returned to my country last week,0
583,do not expect a repair under warranty within less than weeks,0
584,i could not restore my system back to its previous state,0
585,it would be nice if the ram could be upgraded but it isnt and the amount included here is sufficient,1
586,there is no way the battery would last to get any work done,0
587,if a product like this cant last even years what is the guarantee it will last beyond three years,0
588,the cpu runs at when it is searching then slows to a crawl for the next mins as it downloadsinstalls what it finds then a few minutes later searches for something again,0
589,today less than months after getting it back from their service center the hdmi port stops working,0
590,given their ability to destroy things i got an extra two year warranty,0
591,ive read where the screen on the hp is better and it would be great if there were lighting for the keyboard but other than that go for it,1
592,it would be nice to have more than usb ports but they are usb,1
593,i purchased this for my daughter who just started college last year and needed a laptop,0
594,i did order the samsung evo gb inch sata iii internal ssd i will install it in the extra drive port or whatever you call it,0
595,i like that it updates regularly and that i dont have to worry about viruses as all programs are on the cloud,0
596,as a side note this is now last years model so thats why its been discounted at the time,0
597,they arent joking when they say it lasts up to hours just plug it in at night and it will last all day,0
598,this is the fourth acer outfit i have shipped back to repair replace or the computer in less than one year,0
599,the cons i see in it is that the keyboard is not backlit and the battery life is less than hours,0
600,and on initial turn on there should be a series of splash screens with what to do sign in options securityprivacy options basic keyboardtouchpadstoragebrowseretc,0
601,i thought it would be nice to watch games on an screen,1
602,if you buy this computer i hope you are willing to make it your full time job keeping it working and dealing with the issues through dell dell inspiron inch in convertible touchscreen laptop i slv,1
603,he is an engineering student sophmore and the computer is a big part of his daily life,0
604,folds flat to converts to a tablet computeri ended up sending it back and getting an hp stream that does have those features and my wife loves that one,0
605,one star had laptop for three days on third day got blue screen saying laptop needs to be repaired,0
606,i believe this is the price performance king the i offers about a performance gain but the extra cost coupled with having to get a k touch screen save the money touch on a laptop is a gimmick cost you about battery life means its not worth the extra money,0
607,this problem has been happening about every minutes for the last four hours,0
608,battery doesnt hold a charge i have had the computer for less than months,0
609,in order to share screens on skype you have to download the desktop version of skype because the regular one that is already installed on the laptop does not have that feature yet,0
610,for the price i paid even with upgrading the ram to gb i still payed much less than comparable laptops,0
611,also the computer came with a few apps already installed that were a waste of space like candy crush,0
612,it doesnt help that there are a few hurdles to jump with the operating system and the missing peripherals that should have been included for the price throw all this into a pot and you end up with stars,0
613,lastly i seem to hear some type of noise in the laptop as well,0
614,at this rate the drive will easily last another years hopefully by then we will have something a little better but most likely ill end up upgrading to something else far sooner,1
615,i have been using this as my daily driver since i got it last month,0
616,i have been using this product since last one month and it crashed a couple of times,0
617,i took it on a trip and in less than hours it died on the plane,0
618,last toshiba product i will ever buy,0
619,then same problem on next power up,0
620,you can connect an external keyboard and mouse via bluetooth or use one of two usb ports located on each side of the computer and you can use standard mini jack headphones,0
621,i tried to troubleshoot and burned through the last of the battery doing so,0
622,notes when i initially ordered this product i received a faulty product that had an unresponsive and physically damaged space bar and was missing a power cable,0
623,i rolled back to a previous windows state and updated the drivers manually to fix the problem,0
624,this acer replaces a dell i bought last year that keeps dropping wireless internet connection,0
625,we have not seen the same problem with the second computer,0
626,my last computer i had to bid at the second point,0
627,my year old granddaughter had this chromebook for less than months and the screen just popped in the middle of watching a movie on nextflixs we contacted acer it was still under warranty,0
628,my last straw was when i uploaded a few pics from my sd card,0
629,i will say i use a computer much less often now that i have a chromebook so if youre looking to break a technology addiction this device might help you do so,0
630,im not a big laptop user prior to this but i do everything i can on this now,0
631,ive had it less than a year and it keeps shutting itself off,0
632,after attempting to plug in and analog headset i noticed the ports on the left side werent seated in the casing properly,0
633,i dont know why i even bother using a regular computer,0
634,since getting a nexus last year my laptop has been collecting dust at home,0
635,this review is for the i model which i received less than a week ago as of this writing,0
636,if you get a no boot screen hopefully my fix here will help,1
637,i just hope the internal battery can be changed in the future when it stops holding charge,0
638,i tried to fix it for a few hours before i gave up and just restored from factory default settings which took several hours,0
639,in my case i get hours with regular use,0
640,when you select an item or program to run it will take several seconds for the computer to decide what it wants to do,0
641,lastly the argument that you can buy a computer from xyz company that has ten times the speed and power for,0
642,so pointless why the heck are the speakers on the bottom of the computer i wish there was better,1
643,hopefully battery issues will be addressed soon,1
644,laptop starts up in less than secs from pushing the power button,0
645,i have one and bought this one for my sister who has spent the last years avoiding computers she loves it,0
646,the left hinge was extremely loose upon unboxing which caused the screen to wobble back and forth when moving the laptop anywhere,0
647,second wish the laptop was touch screen no big deal tho,0
648,with this kind of ripping off from loyal customer i would like to ask asus whether or not its loyal customer stick to asus if yes for what reason,1
649,last about an hour or if your gaming,0
650,reset again which took hours then blue screen one after another and could not get back into the system,0
651,it does have a slot for a memory card to expand the memory but just seems like it would be easier to have another to gigs from the factory,1
652,i ended up missing the touch screen with windows so i bought this dell,0
653,note i bought the macbook air model for tax in may so i am not comparing the uxfa usm to the regular price macbook,0
654,might be strange for those used to standard widescreen but it plays to the chromebooks advantage of web browsing,0
655,battery last forever,0
656,no regular size ports so you need adapters,0
657,i dont know if there is an extra internal port,0
658,i bought this laptop less than two years ago,0
659,i will now be going back to pc where i can get a junk computer for half the price of the garbage apple now pedals,0
660,generally the speakers arent very high quality but headphone jack is fine if it had an sd card slot for expandable memory if the hard disk was larger than gigs to store more downloaded movies a setting to change text size of everything would be nice hard to use the device lying down as the text is a bit small when my eyes are feet away as they generally are when i try to use a laptop lying down,1
661,it would be nice if the documentation pointed that out,1
662,i never even had the chance to use it away from my desk or outside of my apartment,0
663,it would barely last hours on wifi browsing on battery save mode,0
664,thought the battery would last longer,0
665,this one was cost a bit less and does have a lower end graphics card but it does the job for me,0
666,i manually turned it off and on several times over the course of half an hour to no avail,0
667,one of the last things i can try and do now is to disable indexing but that would remove the search feature from the computer,0
668,have used it for several hours and at four and a half hours battery does not show much charge left,0
669,strangely colored bars would sometimes cross the screen,0
670,i wanted a screen so opted for a bit less memory etc,0
671,then last month it just refuse to turn on battery if fully charge so i could not figure out the problem,0
672,its fun and it can be useful in a couple of circumstances but i would have preferred a cheaper computer with a regular screen,0
673,this chromebook was for a relative who was just starting out in the computer world,0
674,hp yearwarranty pur hp pav nbproduct number ueda processing also the newest i hq processor is the kaby lake family so if your getting a skylake that is last years processor,0
675,i called acer technical support multiple times and even sent it back to acers repair center for weeks,0
676,pair it with a keyboard that has a finger touchpad instead of a mouse and look for apps that do what you are used to doing on a regular computer,0
677,one last point do get the i gb of ram and the gb hdd,0
678,i will say that at the moment after my last visit from geek squad it seems to be operating correctly but it will be my last dell,0
679,my husband then took another chance and reordered the same model but again from a third party seller,0
680,edit less than a year after purchase the keyboard began malfunctioning,0
681,i havent used this computer in a while since i got it last year,0
682,overall solid computer,0
683,if you are looking for something more portable i would suggest the acer r or the acer chromebook but if you are in the market for a larger model with an amazing screen this does the job,1
684,same speed measured from usb hdd to the internal tb rpm storage from spec,0
685,this is not a refurbished product there is no excuse,0
686,i dont know if power users will love it but it works with my slightly lowered expectations,1
687,this might require you to buy an adapter and to bring it with you if youre e g using it to give public powerpoints,0
688,the chromebook flip cpa looks and feels the same as last years model but now has a faster processor that works well with android apps and games,0
689,i contacted dell customer services which seems to have no contact with the technical guys in texas after explaining the process to repeat the issue on paper the guys that supposedly repaired the laptop did not read it at all i received my laptop back and the problem was still there,0
690,it was no a surprise at all to get hours of regular use from it so lightweight,0
691,i ordered one and less then a week later the screen went white,0
692,i chose this over the equivalently priced asus chromebook because i thought it would be nice to run the full office suite on it for work but ended up returning it after less than a day of use,1
693,it starts up in less than seconds and it connects my google and youtube accounts automatically,0
694,this is my second laptop in less than two years each had windows and both have wifi connectivity issues,0
695,less than year later months computer died,0
696,fell apart in less than a year,0
697,in the last month i have issues with it freezing and now it keeps having disk errors and will no longer work,0
698,had the computer for less than hours and needed to call tech support to assist us with a setupsoftware issue,0
699,this is the second computer i bought in the last month like this,0
700,after having the laptop for a month and a half i have gotten a blank screen,0
702,i guess i cant compare this with my last computer which was a sony vaio,0
703,with windows and quickboot my pc boots from power button to usable start screen in less than seconds,0
704,although it hasnt been my daily driver still used my pc for gaming video editing and photo editing occasionally this laptop had everything i was looking for with a few drawbacks at that,0
705,i almost prefer using my chromebook now to my regular computer if im not doing anything that requires software,0
706,a less informed user might panic and send it back,0
707,yep its my fault and even though i never use the touch pad anyway because i prefer my bluetooth mouse it would be nice to have a functioning unit since its brand new and you never know when youll run out of batteries for the mouse,1
708,windows is a joke perpetrated by computer geeks at microsoft upon the computer buyng public,0
709,switched on following morning and all i see is the power button glow rainbows either blue orange or red in colors backlit all keys on my keyboard are lit and screen never turned on even after an hour,0
710,received item laptop was defect and i would like a replacement for the defected item would like same brand and make dell inspiron i with touch screen,1
711,used it for a few hours then left it on my desk,0
712,it doesnt last couple hours,0
713,i took my chromebook into a mac store in portland oregon last february and the employees there were amazed,0
714,there was something missing from the front of the computer,0
715,theres some reigning historical trauma at work here with people recalling the day when pcs bluescreened and macs were above that,0
716,with the stock li ion battery i never get less than four hours of runtime with the backlight turned up three quarters of the way and wi fi enabled,0
717,lastly the alienware logo just below the screen is you guessed it blue,0
718,my laptop was defective when it came in screen going blank every few minutes battery life issues trackpad issues and so forth,0
719,seems like a very solid computer that will last,0
720,its big trick is that the screen folds back and converts this laptop into a tablet,0
721,you have to drag it from the left back on to your screen,0
722,this will be our last dell product ever,0
723,i have been a mac man the last years and this surface book has brought me back to microsoft,0
724,it looks feels and performs like a premium computer but costs hundreds less,0
725,you will have to rethink everything you know about regular computers and become proficient with the web to use this with ease,0
726,i dont need to use skypeitunes or any of those programs so im not missing out on those,0
727,within a few months i had to replace the tb hybrid drive with a solid state drive after several hours of reading lenovo support forums and attempting software and bios fixes,0
728,last time i buy an asus product,0
729,i also bought the year accidental damage warranty for less than,0
730,this is my third apple laptop in the last six years,0
731,as a mac owner for almost ten years and this is my th macbook pro i was dissapointed with a few things,0
732,but after some driver updates the bsods would happen less and less and as for the touch pad i didnt care since i use an external mouse,0
733,email netflix social media google drive spotify skype on the way google hangouts facebook video chat,0
734,it would be nice to have the extra hard drive space ram and a blu ray player but this system has met and exceeded every benchmark i have put before it,1
735,at this point i laughed and could not believe they said this laptops that last for several years are intended to support upgrading operating systems,0
736,i wanted battery life that could last all day if needed,0
737,cpu temps regularly over,0
738,i have used it less than hours so i can not say if there are any quirks or problems,0
739,in time i hope the touch screen will prove to be more useful than ive found it to be so far especially as i look into using android apps,1
740,i only have things that i wish this computer had or would improve upon a built in dvdbluray burner,1
741,i bought one months ago and came back for a blue as a gift for my husband,0
742,i received my laptop and as i booted it up it told me i was missing my operator system,0
743,there is no way to contact the vendor blazing prices nor amazon to rectify this problem lenovo thinkpad t premium built business laptop computer intel dual core i up to ghz processor gb memory gb hdd webcam dvd windows professional certified refurbished the second thing is that there is also no dvd player that is also listed as being included,0
744,this is the fourth and last hp product i will buy,0
745,on chromebooks that slot can be very useful as a means of augmenting its limited onboard storage for playing back media etc,0
746,i couldnt use a standard micro sd card because the adapter is the same size as the regular sd card,0
747,also the track pad is less convenient way to just tap the screen,0
748,i had my last computer toshiba a few years before it started failing,0
749,i will be returning this computer for a regular pc,0
750,got it as an inexpensive alternative for my kids to access the internet they didnt need a regular laptop,0
751,battery my c suffered from a less than hour battery life,0
752,this one deal saved me the price of the kindle when i bought it last year,0
753,was suppose to have a day warranty yet now im told less than a month after purchase that my warranty has expired,0
754,when clicking on a dropdown menu the computer likes to f with me and drop it down for a split second and then pull it back up again,0
755,i thought it would be a cool feature to have but ive found there are hardly any occasions for me when its useful,1
756,however the speakers were so under powered that i couldnt hear them when i brought the computer outside on my deck,0
757,my web cam stop working less than a year of purchase,0
758,getting the sale department takes less than seconds customer support is a voice mail informing you the wait will be at lease min,0
759,last week it would not turn on took it to a computer repair shop and they said the mother board was shot and would cost over,0
760,i had this laptop for less than a month and this is the second time the touchscreen stop working,0
761,last thing i did was follow a review about upgrading the ram,0
762,the battery life may last for a few days with continuous use without the charger,0
763,lastly the sd card slot ate my sd card,0
764,it would be nice if the hard drive was twice the size but it is big enough to install the apps code and most of the data i need,1
765,this computer worked less than a week,0
766,this laptop is lightweight heat less noiseless and battery lasts for ever what else do you want from a portable computer,0
767,my back ground with apple products is quite limited,0
768,i purchased this less than months ago and now the power cord wont charge the laptop,0
769,so after some debating i made the decision to go with the cb not knowing if it would be as good as the c but reading it was fan less and a tad lighter gave me greater interest and while there are some negative reviews on the baytrail vs the haswell cpu with regards to performance i really never push it to the extent of these benchmark tests and rarely have more than tabs open,1
770,im a basic user surf the net do online banking and shopping ms office email and digital photo stuff,0
771,to last hours you would have to like not use it at all,0
772,i feel that missing a touch screen in a laptop today is a mistake,0
773,it would be nice if the sd cards on these devices fit flush with the case so they could be left in less chance of losing it,1
774,although i am a samsung note smartphone owner ive purchased asus chromebooks in the last years,0
775,update have received two chromebooks that within days stopped turning on and when charging the battery flight would flicker between blue red and purple,0
776,i got this laptop december of last year and wanted to wait some time before reviewing,0
777,after using it for the last month the battery is holding up in the hour range,0
778,i think i have a lemon battery but its outside the return window so,0
779,battery does last hours,0
780,i told her then and i could tell she couldnt have cared any less that they just lost me as a customer and their computer is going back to them,0
781,i tried to take a my time with this review as i wanted to give the laptop time to see if i would start experiencing blue screens or crashes after hours of gaming and numerous updates but im glad to say that at this point i havent had any issues running whichever game i chose hopefully i didnt jinx that battery the battery life for this wh battery is pretty decent,1
782,last asus product i will ever purchase,0
783,but now less than months later the display is failing,0
784,i called samsung and after spending an hour on the phone with a technician who could barely understand me he emailed me label to send it back to them for repair,0
785,i had owned a samsung chromebook a few years back,0
787,i bought this computer for my boyfriend last christmas,0
788,lastly wait until the unit is around battery left to charge,0
789,so i hope it will last for a few years,0
790,in the past when flying all day and waiting for connecting flights i would take a power bank with me so having the extra juice in the notebook is much more preferable to me than having to remember to bring one more thing and juggling the items when having to use the power bank when needed the processor speed is up from to ghz as it has the latest th generation intel core i u there is supposed to be an option to get this model with the better seventh generation of core i processor aka intel kaby lake w gb of ram wa tb drive but then again i read that it was supposed to be released to so take that with a grain of salt speakers are stellar imo crisp clear not tinny at all i tend to use earbuds most of the time but they have sufficient volume to listen to easily without earbuds they have the latest usb type c w full size hdmi headset jack sizes the webcam is as advertised good in low light no complaints there the graphics card an integrated intel hd is good for watching movies but it is not meant for gaming nor does it excel in that area so my sons are not drooling over this which for me is a good thing the ram is gb sufficient but would have liked to add more if there was an option as i said before i dont know if there are any options to configure this w other features because as of now i ca nt get any info from hp the price is down from the last entry level envy but i would have rather had the price stay the same or even increase w more upgrades included the issues that i have that are still very disconcerting are these the hinges whether or not they have been improved remains to be seen along with the downgraded screen resolution and no driverssoftware downloads available at this point in their proposed release date which has already passed not being able to wipe the system to remove the bloatware or have any tech support thus the stars,1
791,ssd require less power produce less heat and weigh less than hdd,0
792,the battery lasts me all day with regular use no problem,0
793,secondly after about months of owning the product the screen is starting to get fuzzy,0
794,this computers battery life is less than minutes,0
795,since it is a chromebook if it is lost or damaged i can buy another chromebook and have all my settings and apps back in about half an hour using mcds wifi,0
796,i wish the screen was brighter like an ipad but i guess im so used to the sharp perfect brightness of apple products that this seems a little less bright than i would like but oh well still a good purchase since i wouldnt want to spend as much on a macbook,1
797,overall it just feels and looks like your solid quality american made product,0
798,the battery life is less than of what apple advertises,0
799,windows boot from the bios to logon screen less than seconds,0
800,i paid less that when i purchased this a year ago,0
801,from the outside it remains the same but inside the macbook pro with retina display feels like its way ahead of last years model,0
802,my last laptop was a dell with a screen,0
803,it allowed us to give her a computer without breaking the bank and with less worry about it breaking,0
804,it was a regular computer not a touchsreen,0
805,my only gripe if i had to have one is that i wish the screen was a little bit bigger but i am very happy with this thing,1
806,i have owned dozens of computers over the last years,0
807,after less than hours of work on this computer it quit functioning wont boot,0
808,im not a big fan of how all the outlets are on the back on the computer either,0
809,my suggestion its worth it for the extra ram to keep it useful longer,0
810,i purchased this last year in june for my granddaughters birthday,0
811,my initial observations are that yes there are a few quirks with the power,0
812,i had it less then hours,0
813,meanwhile my battery charged less and less,0
814,the battery was supposed to last hours every time i used it it holds charge for hour and minutes,0
815,dont expect battery time to last the hours they tell you,0
816,battery used to last hours now lasts,0
817,maybe things have changed since my last acer machine a few years back and im just being overly paranoidcautious but im really hoping to keep this one around for a while,0
818,im a computer consultant and regularly purchase computers for my clients,0
819,last week after the warranty was expired the thing actually caught fire,0
820,the last one screen lasts minutes,0
821,the ips screen is a delight although the maximum brightness setting may be less than you were expecting even though it is quite usable,0
822,after less than hours of use it is being sent back,0
823,tried to send it back to dell with no expectation of a refund and customer care actually told me to look up the address on line,0
824,i would buy this again but i think these will last four or five years,0
825,i did have some initial problem with the i got blue screen messages a few times and the laptop did not seem to be charging properly,0
826,i bought this computer in dec it stopped working less than a month later,0
827,i have been using this computer for a few weeks and several keys have stopped working,0
828,we also have lots of units that the battery ceases to function if left in sleep for longer than a few days,0
829,so when i saw this i thought it would be perfect to take places and to have with me when im just browsing the web on the couch or in bed,1
830,however two months after purchase last august the screen started flashing on and off,0
831,a few weeks ago the bottom left hinge broke while i was still under warranty and acer said that i would have to pay dollars to get it repaired,0
832,a few days later i received the zenbook there was a display issue,0
833,its the last menu item,0
834,very few pre installed bloatware means less time you have to waste cleaning it,0
836,i couldnt drag and drop items in it but after i changed the behavior in settings everything went well from there,0
837,i bought one of these chromebooks for my husband last year,0
838,if i had one complaint it would be the small ssd hard drive at just over gigs but i cant even be mad as i frequently experience boot up times of less than seconds and the laptop is able to have a second hard drive installed for more storage,1
839,i have not used a chromebook with less than gb of ram but i would not recommend any less,0
840,i wish this model had stars from all people,1
841,it happened on and off like that for the next week being anywhere from a few hours to a few months off,0
842,i was outside my year warranty,0
843,purchased this laptop less than a year ago and it is barely if at all working anymore,0
844,the touch pad is also a bit less responsive than the ones i am used to so sometimes i have to try several times to click on or drag an item,0
845,i expect the usb c ecosystem to expand rapidly in the next few months,0
846,the nvidia g whatever chip i could care less about in this computer,0
847,i installed one on mine but found that i never switched over to it and so uninstalled it subsequently,0
848,the only reason i knocked it down start because it would be nice to have a quad core processor instead of the dual core and usb ports instead of usb and usb but you cant beat this little chromebook sized unit at,1
849,out of the box the computer feels lopsided and hollow,0
850,update had it repaired under warranty and now a few months later it wont boot up,0
851,went to sign in and put my programs on it and it kept coming up drivers missing or not updated,0
852,the screen isn t the best for this price i would like to see ips,1
853,all for less than over years ago,0
854,and dont believe the hour battery bs mine will last about hours between charging,0
855,this will be my last post lenovo will no longer respond to me and im supposing im out all the money i spent on this p o s i had opportunity to e mail some v p of the company and never heard back and now all i get is auto replies saying hold for parts ive decided to go to court and get my money back from somebody i was had and thats all there is to it,0
856,now it is at the point that the back of the case is pulling away from the display screen every time it is opened and closed,0
857,he had a computer that was on its last leg,0
858,i have gotten the battery to last over hours,0
859,tried to insatall windows pro and pro none of them successed missing drivers and could not start after few ms updates,0
860,battery lasts longer and consume less power since this model is not a touch screen model,0
861,one last thing just for the heck of it i did another search on google this time i replaced the name acer with dell you guessed it page after page of links to forums will a host of issues,0
862,however this happened all about this time last year,0
863,the battery also dosent last,0
864,i think the add on works fine and hopefully will eliminate another screen replacement whether on warranty or not,1
865,sign up for the amazon prime thing and you can get this macbook delivered next day for less than the list price,0
866,it would be nice it the in asus transformer book was able to take photos then it really would be a complete recording tool,1
867,i did go back and upgrade the device to windows professional so i could add the media center components that microsoft decided to split out from the basic system,0
868,im not into social networking and purchased the incorrect item,0
869,just bought this less than a year and it already isnt working,0
870,inside and outside this dell was defective and dell has lost a longtime customer and a future customer,0
871,lastly the i processor seals the deal taking on everything ive thrown at it without breaking a sweat,0
872,battery will be a pain to change out if need as back is solid,0
873,the lack of an optical drive in a laptop becomes less and less of an issue now,0
874,it stopped working with less than a year use,0
875,basically its just made to support google everything found on a chrome book can be found on any regular computer with a google chrome browser,0
876,i can not give this laptop that last start for the following reasons there is not option in north america that i can find to get one without the touchscreen,0
877,setup was a snap and dont miss not having an optical drive hopefully this cut down the weight,1
878,i will check back for future models,0
879,it just would be great if asus can fix mentioned problems and make this great laptop even grater,1
880,a new computer should be able to function smoothly,1
881,i couldnt stand to even touch the outside case of the computer,0
882,so i am left with a junk computer that i got less than two months of use out of it,0
883,i had several blue screens of death yes and all the drama that comes with it in the middle of a windows installation,0
884,ive had this for one year it has never worked properly and just got it back from the it repair warrantee place,0
885,and with a third party app you can do the last,0
886,i can think up half a dozen features to improve it that would double or triple the price but for writing reading web browsing and email on the go this cant be beat,0
887,i ordered a replacement one from a outside source for,0
888,lastly for those that need it the y processor supports both vt x and vt d virtualization instruction sets,0
889,i think it is not unreasonable to expect a laptop to last years this one did not even make it halfway,0
890,i wanted to wait several months before i left a review to ensure the product would last,0
891,i sent the machine back twice within the warranty period and both times issues continued a few months later,0
892,i was between the dell xps and the asus zenbook ux but this one takes the cake because it had a regular sized hdmi port and usb c,0
893,at last i got it to do a system image restore,0
894,i moved the regular to a storage drive for music and movie,0
895,the battery life lasts about hours on maximum screen brightness doing regular tasks,0
896,i kept telling them there was some sort of flag killing the program on a regular basis,0
897,on the left side starting from the rear is the ac port and beside that an rj ethernet jack,0
898,the only real issue this thing has is that it requires a cable between the display and the keyboard to charge them both at the same time this would be a small issue but they put the connectors on opposite sides of the tablet and keyboard so it means you have to have the cable running across the back of the tablet when you are charging both units,1
899,overall this laptop is a beast and totally worth the price,0
900,when he was finished he had dropped my computer replaced it and had it not work and i later discovered scratches on the casing along with three missing screws,0
901,its your basic laptop with all the specs needed to search the net or go on social media or type anything,0
902,the screen regularly goes blank,0
903,i look at events and see that on the last day they had my laptop before they sent it back to me someone had cleared the driver to let windows re install it it re installed and still didnt work,0
905,the computer crashed completely in less than a year,0
906,it is split into two parts which connects to the bottom of the screen and if you just push it in like a regular laptop the case will break,0
907,additionally the laptop has no issue running multiple programs at the same time,0
908,but there is one problem and this means less star for this review cpu temperatures,0
909,i bought this computer less than a year ago,0
910,over the last year ive had continual keyboard problems ive had to reinstall the audio driver times,0
911,i tried several times uninstalling the battery and starting over but ended up with the same result,0
912,the lcd broke but they replaced it under the warranty last month and sent it back to us replaced without problem,0
913,it looks like this charge will last around four hours which included some gaming and video watching so i expect it may go up during lighter use and with battery conservation in mind,0
914,screen no longer works and its been less than two years,0
915,the windows icon in the lower left half of the screen no longer functioned,0
916,seamless downloads and installation of programs and google chrome is a solid cross platform browser,0
917,since ill be his help desk whenever something comes up i figured it would be good to have an identical laptop to what i ordered for him,1
918,i received my chrome book today and have spent the last few hours playing around with this,0
919,half sizing these keys makes them a lot harder to use,0
920,the touch screen is sometimes less responsive in tablet mode compared to the same actions made in laptop mode,0
921,dll files missing or corrupted blue screens of death mentioning ntfs,0
922,i can leave it on for about hours powered on and the battery will drain about or less,0
923,i do really love this computer i hope this doesnt happen again,1
924,i come back its in a blue screen that said it was in automatic repair it gave me the option to restart to see if that would solve the issue it didnt,0
925,i will next try the last remaining support option,0
926,it would be great to drop it on zombies during apocalypse or make running with it in your backpack an olympic event or cruel and unusual torture but mobile and laptop predator is not backpack it doesnt fit,1
927,regular usage it stick in mid s,0
928,it is the crappiest computer ive ever seen much less owned,0
929,it is missing bluetooth and an optical drive,0
930,it last for almost a week and that is hardcore use and it comes with all the usb connectors and a mini usb to usb cable as well,0
931,can downgrade to windows if needed one of the few models left that can do this,0
932,overall solid deal at this price,0
933,we have a asus fla purchased last year,0
934,some games from the last year even play at that frame rate on ultra settings,0
935,its lightweight and the keyboard sounds a bit hollow as one types,0
936,i purchased this item from a local big box because of a promotion they were running,0
938,at less than a month old the screen started to blank out,0
939,not missing the ports,0
940,update last night while i was trying to fall asleep the power brick started making a squealing noise so i unplugged it,0
941,i spent hours on the phone with microsoft trying to troubleshoot a solution with no success,0
942,i had my last chromebook years with multiple drops and slides and clunks and it took them in stride,0
943,charger port is missing the plastic that should be on the bottom cover,0
944,this will be my last razer product and i thoroughly regret my purchase,0
946,for less i could get the specs i wanted minus the in feature and a screen that lets me draw,0
947,the battery on it seems to last about to hours,0
948,the operating system is windows pro which has expanded productivity features than regular version,0
949,but the above issues are causing me one year later to find a replacement,0
951,worked for less than one month and now i have been working with dell for months without any resolution,0
952,i can charge this laptop for a few hours and with that the battery will last all day at school,0
953,it was my daily driver for almost half a year,0
954,the battery last for a couple days,0
955,but now less than two years after buying it the battery no longer charges its stuck at and will not run if not plugged in,0
956,i am rather basic computer user basic word processing spreadsheet digital photo processing and of course email etc,0
957,later when i went to install an ssd i found that the frame of the laptop had actually been bent out of shape,0
958,people are giving it one star does come with a manufactures year warranty so what is the big deal send it back,0
959,this computer hopefully now that jobs is gone who knows what the quality is really like my iphone has been a disappointment recently will hopefully last me another years,1
961,froze on setup had to jump through several hoops including reinstalling the os by flash drive to manage to get it to actually set up properly,0
962,it would be great to take to class as it is relatively light for a large screen laptop and being relatively inexpensive less of a trauma were it lost or stolen than if it cost three times as much,1
963,n b neither shutting off nor starting up did i touch the back of the machine so i dont know how the battery became unlatched,0
964,this was the saddest excuse laptop ive ever encountered,0
965,however days in i find out samsung chromebook touch screens are failure prone didnt expect that from samsung so hopefully the power of amazon can either get a replacemnet refurbished or new one or at least repair it somehow,1
966,initially i thought it was just the os and drivers that were causing the track pad to not register the physical clicks so i updated all of the drivers and reinstalled windows,0
967,can print through regular printer on your network as well as wireless printers,0
968,ive used this computer less than times and havent downloaded anything on it,0
970,ive had the advertised laptop for less than year,0
971,it lacks apples support network and resale value but if it dies in a year you can buy another one and still have spent less than the mac costs,0
972,as others have stated or hours is about what you get with regular browsing not hours,0
973,im a computer programming student and was looking for a laptop i could use regularly to take to class and double as a desktop at home,0
974,my hp envy died out exactly months from purchase screen went blank in the middle of running and computer will not turn back on,0
975,it would be great if an additional ram slot could be given with it as it only has one and comes with gb of ram which is very less for u will have to purchase additional ram gb to get a good speed with the software and os a big negative for this laptop,1
976,when i stated that it would be better to return the item and get a cheaper one if it didnt have a year warranty,1
977,i have to resize and drag them all back into place every time i wake it up,0
978,if you actually want to do anything later though youll have to buy another computer,0
979,i can change the volume by using the settings charm as well but it would be great if there were a volume button or else another fn key on the right somewhere,1
980,it weights less and is thinner than the macbook air and its design is so asthetically pleasing,0
981,laptop arrived without battery and this model has it inside the fixed enclosure so sending it back in less than hours of arrival,0
982,that means that the biggest microsd card that i could find that would work in this machine is gb or less,0
983,it need two factory reset in less than one year,0
984,less than months since purchased and the computer turns off as soon as it is unplugged,0
985,the display itself is actually a portrait x rather than x yet at the same time the acer logos on both the front and back are oriented in landscape,0
986,another thing to notice is that her laptop came with white painting stains the battery was already inside instead of being properly packed but this is the sellers fault,0
987,ive had this laptop for less than four months and am now running into hardware problems,0
988,after the last reset the keyboardmouse and touchscreen would not respond to user input when windows loaded up although in the bios it worked,0
989,graphics it has a gtx in it for less than,0
990,it will last through one session of using my laptop without plugging it in maybe hours,0
991,but performs well for price no issues at present have been using for last month,0
992,what happens is when you select your customization from the setup you get to the very last step and then the computer errors out and reboots,0
993,it wont connect to public wifi it wont continue on my home wifi this happened this year i think,0
994,lastly i dont intend to upgrade neither the hd nor the ram however if u do lots of reviews say it cant be done on this model of asus zenbook,0
995,after installing additional gb memory and ssd laptop boots up in less than seconds from power off,0
996,it would be nice if the software could store appsdownloaded content on the sd card but maybe that will come down the road in chrome os,1
997,add a usb external drive or usb stick and i have local storage though the chromebook comes with years of google drive storage,0
998,we have had this product for less than one year months acutually,0
999,it would not let me or anyone log on less than years after purchase,0
1000,as for the operating system ive grown accustomed to it after a few months and i have no reason to go back to windows mac os or a desktop linux os,0
1001,dont listen to any reviews saying slow or lack of memory this s is so easily upgradable and a great price added a gb m ssd if you take the time and read the manual you can see the endless possibilities and you get windows on top it would be foolish not to buy this the upgrades are plug and play i going to trade my wifes stream in to buy her one of these back boys she will only need a gb m making it a bargain i burnt out my lenovo v it was a beast i started doing some recent and came to this logical choice was weary of netbooks and even online electronic sales because of the returns but it would have cost more to remake the v very satisfied and the new s is going on a couple months old now still satisfiedthankspjc,1
1002,stopped working less than a month after support expired,0
1003,it is supposed to be the fastest standard on the market nvme not the standard of a few years back,0
1004,well turn on turbo in magician software and all others drives are left at less then half the speeds in any area,0
1005,the seller stated on the amazon as the battery last up to hours,0
1006,i later found out that my laptop had decided the processor was actually the proper gpu,0
1007,the laptop updated itself to the point where there wasnt space on the laptop anymore in less than a year,0
1008,the battery life is less than an hour unplugged on brightness,0
1009,the screen went off center from the hinge and i had to ship it back for them to fix it,0
1010,the backlight is the way to go my last toshiba had a backlight and i will never again buy a laptop or computer keyboard without one,0
1011,over the next day or so it would return with the same os missing report,0
1012,this may just be an issue with a missing or unupdated driver,0
1013,in a few weeks computer comes back with screen problems,0
1014,ngwmg wireless ac dual band x acbluetooth vpro in case you wanted to upgrade a wifi card and it supports windows over all iam pleased with the dell inspiron in and more thing on the th gen i dell in laptop with the gb sshd hard drive and gb memory the fan on it kept coming on all the time even surfing the internet but i now have the th gen skylake i inspiron in dell laptop with the gb ssd hard drive and gb of memory it is quiet seems to run cooler and the fan hardly ever comes on which is a good thing because i use for college and bible study wanted to update it more to say i love the dell inch in after i updated the graphic card driver from the dell websight no more video card stopping erors and i had complents on the screen size is perfect for watching movies and other tasks i forgot more detail hp in laptops are nice too but they the soderd memory to the motherboard so if the memory goes bad you can not change it out even to upgrade from gb to gb like the dell in one laptop another fact about the hp in laptops the only use ssd drives not even the sshd you cant upgrade to there not even the drives they are the smaller skinny drives sort of like a memory stick that is why i chose dell over hp laptop i also heard possabilly they might come out with a gb laptop memory that is for intel chips that might fight the dell inspiron inch in laptops this laptop already has gb which already good it would be nice to up grade memory i would recommend this dell inspiron to my friends,1
1015,look i was just a kid going into my senior year of high school and i wanted a laptop because i felt it would be beneficial and a nice thing just to have going into college the next year,1
1016,the battery can last up to about hours if youre just surfing the internet,0
1017,i really do not understand the idea of removing ports that makes the laptops less useful,0
1018,but there is no real technical support from any of these companies who provide the software operating system or drivers for the machine,0
1019,update in the last months after buying it ive had it as a working product for about weeks a defective product for months and in asus repair shop for months,0
1020,a lot of programs are aimed at social media and we dont need to be social at our age,0
1021,windows doesnt do multiple desktops in the classic interface natively,0
1022,ive had this less than a year and it is still in mint condition but wont even turn on now,0
1023,i recommend this for your regular daily driver,0
1024,the fact that the i ships with gb ram in addition to the fact that i had trouble replacing the gb module with an gb module on the i model may suggest that the motherboard itself could be different,1
1025,had to return it missing chrome operating system,0
1026,do your research on what you want out of an computer this wont run much outside of internet and videos,0
1027,for slightly less of a price i might add,0
1028,i didnt want to bring my regular laptop with me because of its size and weight,0
1029,comquestionstrusty on sd card under crouton corrupted diskits a very useful machine once crouton is installed otherwise functionality is very limited,0
1030,the bottom half of the computer has star wars universe writing underneath and a speaker stretching along underneath it next to the power button,0
1031,after installing a firmware update several driver updates and a few hours on the phone with support i was advised i had to ship it back to dell for weeks so they can fix it,0
1032,boots up to windows from power off in less than seconds,0
1033,i upgraded to a solid state drive and my battery life is still garbage ssds use less power than a standard hd,0
1034,and the battery life was less than favorable even when i replaced the battery,0
1035,i often like to navigate using my fingers and regularly try to touch my screen on my desktop out of habit,0
1036,this does not work like a regular computer operating system it is a step below,0
1037,business users need to allow apps in their settings as opposed to regular google users can add as they wish,0
1038,laptop tells me there is not even a battery in the computer now much less that it wont take a charge,0
1039,i believe if you download the acronis disk clone software from western digital it will also work on this drive but i used the version that came with an old kingston ssd so i cant guarantee it,0
1040,after receiving it back within another month it started blue screening repeatedly again,0
1041,the asus i ordered was going back before i even had a chance to turn it on and see that windows hadnt even been properly installed,0
1042,google saved all my info of course so my set up looks basically the same as it did on my last system,0
1043,again it would be nice to have a working product out of the box but anyways here is my impression so far i have literally days with it so i will update my review when i have a chance to test it further,1
1044,i began doing research on something less pricey,0
1045,the second is of the asus glvm which uses a ntsc color gamut ips display lg lpwf spb lgdf to be specific,0
1046,in fact i think the specced hour battery life might actually be understating it mine has been lasting longer than that,0
1047,battery seems to last forever definitely a big plus,0
1048,less than that if you have a google account,0
1049,overall this laptop earns a solid a from this user,0
1050,i have the inch model and the battery last for ever im getting over hours per charge with lots of websurfing and music playing,0
1051,the last thing is its weight,0
1052,note theres a link out there to build windows install media and you have to choose the regular windows version to build onto a dvd or usb thumb drive,0
1053,for a mac user this is maddening and so last century,0
1054,last year i bought my mom a chromebook for christmas,0
1055,now less than years later its going into the trash,0
1056,in less than two months my xps is now sitting at their repair shop in tx because there is no power,0
1057,the fingerprints on the display need to be cleaned regularly,0
1058,running music gave me about an hour less of time,0
1059,left mouse button on the touchpad stopped working less than a year after purchase,0
1060,is it perfect no it is not i would love to see a bigger ssd or at least an user upgradeable ssd and maybe an sd slot would be nice but not sure how much i would use it and i am sure we would all love to have a longer battery life on it,1
1061,next time i will probably pay extra and buy a computer that comes with at home service or an apple,0
1062,when opened and powered it up the following message had displayed chrome os is missing or damaged,0
1063,rufino s ignacio a regular customer of amazon,0
1064,id also recommend this to anyone who wants to stay connected with their parent or relative that may also not be versed with technologies,0
1065,i am still on the fence as to whether it will actually find a permanent useful place in my computing life,0
1066,i just recently went back to a standard laptop njk from a zenbook after using zenbooks for years,0
1067,however battery life was substantially less than advertised up to hours,0
1068,ive had this less than a year and will be using my warranty to have them look at it because i have tried the fixes on the lenovo pages,0
1069,ive seen some reviews saying its underpowered but it managed on the fishbowl test and can stream without stuttering to my chromecast in p my last chromebook hp couldnt even do that,0
1070,i will update later probably in a few hours after updates to comment on how it operates,0
1071,i bought a macbook from them last year,0
1072,dont expect the battery to last longer than hours,0
1073,this computer stopped working in less than months,0
1074,we put recubbery partition dare day call us less for tech support,0
1075,stars because although it crapped out on me after less than years it met my needs otherwise,0
1076,i talked to technical support and they said i have to do a factory reset which would take it back to how it came from the factory,0
1077,i will upgrade the ram to gb here in the next few weeks,0
1078,i wish the screen was just a bit brighter thats my only complaint,1
1079,until the zenbook i never realized how noisy my regular computer truly was,0
1080,i wasted so much money from buying laptop computers of wasted money kristin noel,0
1081,you need to have a regular pc as your mothership computer on which your printer drivers can be installed,0
1082,so i started to look at the macbook air because it had all the ports and lighter but without the retina screen but also with less ram,0
1083,i had my mac set up in less than an hour,0
1084,youll get probably two to three hours unplugged regular use not gaming,0
1085,i bought this computer in august of last year,0
1086,then it started to display chrome logo screen then blank for a few seconds,0
1087,the onedrive could come as a windows package but the user should be able to uninstall it if heshe does not want to use it,1
1088,i am going to contact the company and hopefully get a resolution to the issue,1
1089,the fan rpm on idle state and noise decibel test does no go less than laptops should be max decibel,0
1090,girlfriend wanted a laptop but doesnt actually use computers for anything but standard girl stuff so netflix chromecast facebook google,0
1091,asus international warranty has a big question mark because i was denied warranty claims in one country because it was out of region,0
1092,i will say i didnt think the fact that the screen folds flat would ever be useful but then the guy next to me in a lecture hall got his macbook pro knocked off his desk because someone bumped the screen as they walked by and tipped it over,0
1093,i decided to contact lenovo support number included with the product and i did find out that the machine is under next day repair warranty so they are actually sending someone out to my house to fix this tomorrow,0
1094,this means changing volume is inherently a two handed procedure or a huge stretch of the hand this is too nitpicky for the price but it would be nice if the lid were made of slightly thicker metal so it had less flex,1

1108,this computer has lasted less than,0
1109,theres simply no excuse to release a product with those problems,0
1110,f the power unit the cable for power out sticks out like a sore from the middle of the power unit and square is jutting out the design should have had the cable coming out flush rather than a tail is a hindrance in storing the cable as winding it plus susceptible to damage for the reasons above,0
1111,now it is three months later and the screen is grey and nothing works,0
1112,while i understand that trim makes the drive last longer does this explain the drive failing,0
1113,i waited a few minutes to see if they would call me back cause i had giving my number to each and everyone of them,0
1114,lastly it seems to me these days that manufactures want weight saving cut costscorners while trying to meet the demand,0
1115,it will last about or hours unplugged with the screen closed and about hours with regular use,0
1116,a few noticeable plastic parts here and there but overall it feels like a machine i want to be working or playing on,0

1133,iafter opening and setting up laptop the battery would die within minutes less than,0
1134,it worked for about a week and now all i get is the blank blue screen when i turn it on,0

1163,the keyboard is solid as is the touchscreen and overall assembly,0

1166,i decided to update my i asus laptop to this last year,0
1167,it would be great for doing homework browsing the net email light gaming social media and sending with your child to college,1
1168,any time you need programs on there like for schools the unit takes to long to startupas long no additional program are put on and only for online viewing it will work would be a lot better to have a touchscreen on it to make it somehow workable,1
1169,i actually bought it for my visually impaired mother to stream to her big screen tv,0
1170,i bought one last year and got another one for my wife,0

1178,battery does not last as advertised,0
1179,now for sure its not super cheap thats why i think it would be great if samsung could lower the retail price to about then i really think it should be a no brainer,1

1181,my girl owns a sony vaio i got her last year and i cant stand typing on that thing,0
1182,needed a lightweight laptop for work and school and something reliable for multiple uses with ability to project multimedia to a second monitor for regular multitasking i rely on to cut my work time down radically a third to a half,0
1184,if youre going to be staring at a terminal all day or programming then this should be less of an issue,0
1185,it is quite possible that i would be able to upgrade if i did not have bitdefender security installed but it is necessary to protect my information while browsing the web,1
1186,so now i have something even less functional as a computer than my iphone,0
1187,if need be i can just buy another one next year and probably for less being that since ive purchased it the price has gone from to,0
1188,it would be nice to have a higher resolution screen but it is good enough and the brightness is absolutely fine,1
1189,also supported is australian scrolling where two finger scrolling will scroll the screen in the same direction your fingers are going like a smartphone,0
1190,i spent two hours trying to figure it out then contacted asus who took three days over a non working website to get back to me,0
1191,i have had windows for the last years,0
1192,expect it to be at the same battery level you left it when you put it to sleep,0
1193,jack and usb placement i wish everything was on the left side or at least on the same side,1
1194,the regular hds installed in our laptops were lower rpms and lower seek times to save battery life,0
1195,regarding items this laptop is sleek and has a solid build must be less than,0
1196,the popups and viruses that virtually made my last microsoft based computer useles,0
1197,i have been using a hp chromebook for the last year or so and it has replaced everything else for daily use,0
1198,for me the fundamental difference between a pc and a mac is that with a pc you always feel like youre on the outside of the computer trying to work according to its system,0
1199,its probably worth disclosing that i happen to favor chromebooks for my daily non productive activities for a number of reasons i will discuss below,0
1200,it doesnt last a lot less than hours,0
1201,if you are the tech support family member and need to suggest a consumer laptop for a less technical family member the chromebook could be a godsend for you and for them,0

1211,ive had this computer for less than three months and twice ive gotten the error that chrome os is missing or damaged,0
1212,how can i complain for less than cons i didnt realize the screws on the back werent all the same size so that was a pain to try and match the holes upthe keyboard is flexy but not terribleno back lit keyboardcant beat the value,0
1213,charge it once and itll last between and hours,0
1214,i bought my hp laptop in my last year at college three years ago now and we all know that laptops arent built to last a lifetime,0
1215,is a lot to spend for a chrome book that didnt even last a year,0
1216,if this had gb of ram instead and the touchscreenqhd was replaced with regular p and it was sold for i would soooo buy this,0
1217,i bought a gb sd card to go with this to have for external storage but i havent even begun to fill the internal drive so im not worried,0
1218,overall at the price that i purchased the price it is well worth it,0
1220,my last laptop couldnt even last four hours without having to be charged up,0
1221,i have a desktop gaming rig id built a couple years back and it was starting to show its age so i decided my next computer was going to one i could sit on the couch to play,0

1224,the cds i received with windows basically killed the computer and it took a professional to reinstall everything,0
1225,i have had this computer for less than six weeks,0
1226,i would have to physically take apart the bottom of the computer and remove the battery cable put it back and assemble the bottom and the computer would turn back on,0
1227,after notifying dell that i had just purchased this laptop last aug they said that their warranty started as soon as the retailer purchased the laptop in this case,0
1228,so far have not had a issue it runs just as good as my asus gaming laptop now only down side would be the screen is a bit weird of a color you can fix it by messing with the display settings to get it less green also i did have to switch settings to use the nvidia processor in the nvidia control panel once i did so runs even better,1
1229,ive been in contact with the apple customer support team for the last months or so,0
1231,compared with kodi the vlc player is much less processor intensive both with mp and mkv files,0
1232,in around an hour or less so i dont mind no triple screen does not work and i was not expecting it to work,0
1233,it will not last up to hours like said on description,0
1234,overall i think this thing is definitely worth the price,0
1235,no windows laptop offers comparable specs at the same price,0
1236,this will be my last dell purchase in my lifetime,0
1237,battery works about hours of regular web surfing gaming is less about hours with the fans,0
1238,after having this computer for a week i was about to rate it stars but things have improved in the last few days,0
1239,since people generally give reviews right after they receive a product i think it would be great to give people an idea of how a product is running a month and a half into ownershipthe first thing i would like to mention is lag time,1
1240,going for a tb ssd next same brand,0
1241,i initially checked out some chrome books but those devices are basically toys gui interface almost exclusively celeron cpu and gb ram were big turn offs for me,0
1242,battery life is realistically less than hours with highest brightness,0
1243,i tried to contact customer support and they basically told me that it was a motherboard failure something that would be very expensive to fix that practically crippled my system that it wasnt their fault and i was on my own i have never owned a system that becomes practically crippled in a year,1
1244,it shipped to my apartment in less than two business weeks the day before we left which is why i even gave it a two star,0
1245,had to send it back after owning it for less than a year,0
1246,they are now selling the laptop for less and will also not honor the price drop,0
1247,i read in a previous review where this item was compared to a ford f ive owned several f s and have found them to be reliable efficient workhorses that got the work done,0
1248,i bought this netbook in september of last year,0
1249,ive sworn by hp for years but this will be my last purchase,0
1250,weve had this computer for less than weeks,0
1251,not the hp i bought a few years back,0
1252,i did purchase it at wal mart it lasted less then a year,0
1253,last ssds have dropped in price quite a bit so i cant imagine why that wasnt standard,0
1254,it has its limitations but once you adapt to them and see instead the benefits of this machine you will probably never want to go back to a regular computer,0
1255,this last part doesnt factor into my review,0
1256,one last note i tried connecting a classroom projector to my chromebook in order to show a powerpoint presentation all to no avail,0
1257,i like this laptop but just wished the battery would last longer,0
1258,i havent installed chrome yet but it will hopefully take up less system resources,0
1259,so for example if you are looking at a blank white pagescreen it wont be clearly all white the screen will have multi colored blurs as if your screen is smearedgreasy,0
1260,however upon finding out that my university offered computer labs specifically for architects my needs for a laptop became less strenuous,0
1261,the one i received has dead line on the screen shows blue it would be otherwise a nice laptop for the price,1
1262,this is the last time i trust an acer product,0
1263,just wish the battery would last longer,0
1264,i bought this product last year and didnt use it,0
1265,theres no moving parts including the absence of a fan so its virtually silent,0
1266,as i have volunteered for a local senior center teaching computers i would say i have the ability to teach,0
1267,next thing you know my computer died last week and would not charge at all,0
1268,if this model was less i would recommend it to anyone,0
1269,i have used a dell at my office the last years i soley trust this brand,0
1270,i have never owned a computer that turns itself off when it wants to and will not turn back on unless it wants to,0
1271,hours under regular use,0
1272,my wife home schools our kids and has been using google docs for the last couple of years to keep spreadsheets on progress and scores,0
1273,excuse the typos i typed all this on my iphone via diabetic index finger,0
1274,i do plan to carry it occasionally to some events but not daily so the weight is not a problem for me,0
1275,i already sent my computer back once to have the jack replaced and now the second ones breaking down,0
1276,i havent touched my regular office computer since i got this,0
1277,it may be missing the windows program,0
1278,however the item is less by at dell,0
1279,they did offer to charge me to fix a battery that showed or less wear on a diagnostic and that should be working,0
1280,i installed windows to this drive last wednesday and today while i was closing battlefield my computer shut off,0
1281,lastly its interconnectivity,0
1282,last lenovo product i will ever purchase,0
1283,do you want to know why all of the computer magazines rated this as the ssd for the last few months,0
1284,i already set the computer back to factory settings several times and still having the same issues,0
1285,makes me wonder if the battery will last,0
1286,if cpu intensive tasks are a thing you do regularly you should be looking at intel i laptops not any of these chromebooks,0
1287,then just a few nights ago i bent the screen back by accident though not outside the range it was designed to bend,0
1288,in fact hes dropped it multiple times over the last year,0
1289,screen has patch of missing pixels after months of use,0
1290,edit after years of using it daily and almost never turning it off i replaced my whitebook with a retina mbp three years ago but the ol mb still handles basic computer tasks effortlessly,0
1291,this lasted longer than our last chromebook but still didnt last years,0
1292,so i will troubleshoot that and hopefully can use that eventually as a backup drive,1
1293,i had in the last years a windows based laptop,0
1294,in less than years i have had it in for repairs times,0
1295,it will work once if i wipereinstall the product never on subsequent boots,0
1296,in less than ten minutes i had linux installed and running with no issues,0
1297,i put it in my mac mini and now it boots in less than seconds program launches seem instantaneous,0
1299,i already have a few chromebooks of varying sizes but i have been intrigued by the flip since it was introduced last year,0
1300,the last thing i need is another computer but chromebook called to me,0
1301,i also just purchased gb of ram which i will be inserting into my mac manually within the next few days another review on that soon to come,0
1302,i downgraded this to two stars because of the bogus words that the battery will last hours,0
1303,overall if youre a student on a budget looking for a reliable computer a refurbished macbook air is a reliable option and worth the money,0
1304,before i started school last year i picked up a refurbished lenovo t and replaced its hdd with a spare ssd,0
1305,the ram is also less than described,0
1306,cons i have had it less than hours and the computer is unusable because of windows even after the update,0
1307,in fact two regular drives do not compare,0
1308,theres no excuse for a laptop in this price range not to be made out of aluminum,0
1309,ive watched several movies already as well as used microsoft office not the trial version thats included but one i had purchased previously,0
1310,the battery last forever and it turns on a second,0
1311,now im outside of warranty,0
1312,the standard reply is go to the web fish around spend a few hours maybe youll find something mabe you wont,0
1313,update laptop has just had its fourth blue screen while watching malcolm in the middle on netflix,0
1314,update august my computer has been crashing on a regular basis once or twice a day and i have contacted the seller,0
1315,took a break shut it down and came back a couple of hours later,0
1316,after less than years it has died,0
1317,i could not get used to the os system could not drag and drop files,0
1318,the last one i used for years,0
1319,with its portability retina display sleekness and overall quality it makes the journey of purchasing worth every penny,0
1320,windows drivers will work too if any are missing,0
1321,you will find idvd missing from the installed ilife package,0
1322,in addition a lot of blows in the package from the outside,0
1323,some of these changes can be made sans software but to me it was like a big samsung middle finger to me as an amd user,0
1324,it freezes on websites regularly and i have to control alt delete to kill the session multiple times in an hour,0
1325,it would be nice for future models to have a means of upgrading the drive or adding internal storage,1
1326,everything can be run like its a regular desktop and then grab it and go when i need to and still have portability,0
1328,pro star offers the upgrade to the evo for i bought the same one here on amazon for upgrading to gb ram through prostar is another,0
1329,it still left me with three extra slots one on the dongle a one on the hub and one on the laptop itself,0
1330,reality we spent hours and hours working with two of them from the same store locally and both had issues,0
1331,i noticed they were sold out of a few and a slot with the asus c info card was missing the display unit,0
1332,entertainment is second on the list i had to uninstall a few lenovo programs that were causing windows compatibility issues,0
1333,i just received my package last wednesday may,0
1334,addendum had motherboard failures in less than years,0
1335,had computer less than days and it locks up stating needs repair,0
1336,it would be great if i could edit the recording software key and make it launch my own software and make the steam key launch the desktop version of steam,1
1337,died after less than one year of ownership,0
1338,youd expect a rpm drive to be a bit of a drag on performance,0
1339,i was hesitant to buy a chromebook when i looked at them last year,0
1340,but missing the touch screen feature already,0
1341,frankly it should be international law that all laptops have upward facing speakers so that we can actually hear them,0
1342,the overall feel of the laptop is solid again with the aluminum chassis carbon fiber wrapped keyboard area and glass touchpad powered by windows precision drivers,0
1343,i do a lot of development in the cloud and make use of a lot of resources on the net and so reasoned i didnt need to cart around a regular laptop,0
1344,i guess considering the price you get what you pay for but both my phone and samsung nook is faster than this laptop with less crashing and lag,0
1345,however this computer could come with an ssd has its primary drive in stead of a rpm hdd buying a samsung ssd is something almost mandatory with this computer if you dont want a hard drive bottle neck i have a samsung evo ssd and i cant expect anymore speed from any computer,1
1346,come back in a few hours,0
1347,the next question you should ask yourself at this point is why do i need to use these specific programs,0
1348,there are also less hardware components inside these things and therefore they are less prone to malfunctions,0
1349,it literally takes me less than seconds to power up and log on,0
1350,hopefully there wont be any issues with running a gb ram stick with a gb stick i e ram with mismatched sizes,1
1351,i am a retiree and have owned over computers in the last years,0
1352,my asus took less than hour,0

1355,her last laptop was a dell inspiron and she was inclined toward the brand after years the motherboard was failing,0
1356,i wish all other computers were this silent,1
1357,aesthetics and build quality quite good and definitely better than the low price would suggest,1
1358,one of them is dual boot ubuntu so the ssd drive is less than halved,0
1359,my last laptop had a cellphone charger esk plug,0
1360,i got this model as an upgrade to an hp convertible i purchased last year,0
1361,it will not replace your regular pc or macbook pro but googles integrated office software and the app store makes this a competitive piece of hardware,0
1362,i ordered mine had to wait about weeks for it plugged it in turned it on missing or corrupted operating system,0
1363,then technician came to the house and replaced all the parts except the speakers weeks later had same power problem,0

1365,or you can manually push the screen share button to show the outside,0
1366,from the second time i turned it on a blue screen appeared,0
1367,after just a few months the usbs are acting up losing connection at the slightest movement of the cord,0
1368,hopefully its under warranty because we need it for work and it would be down the drain ok as i could reuse the m possibly,1
1369,the last laptop i purchased from asus had to be sent in for year adp warranty service twice,0
1370,boot time is about half that of my hp and scrolling through several tabs appears to be instantaneous on this machine whereas there would be a white screen for a few milliseconds switching tabs on the hp,0
1371,i have owned both pcs and macs over the last years,0
1372,had to return to third party vendor because of blue screen,0
1373,oh by the by i tried the dreaded outside in the california sun screen test,0

1376,i purchased one chromebook last year its conveniently placed on the side table next to sofa,0
1377,technically windows takes a lot of getting used to and requires ms office upgrade which is even harder to get used to,0
1378,around hours regular browsing around to watching videos around gaming,0

1655,i truly believe this is a laptop for any type of work be it design or playing or even just as a regular work station it does it all,0
1656,also your processor will be a hindering bottle neck when gaming causing you to get even less performance,0
1657,the computer regularly freezes in some background loop even after leaving it for hour its still spinning,0
1658,it would be great to load a couple on a flash and have the system recognize them but maybe thats not possible,1
1659,as for charging times this device will fully charge in less than hours while power is off,0
1660,after using this unit for the last months my opinion has changed rather dramatically,0
1661,i have owned this computer for less than hours,0
1662,i got the gb model for so dont even think about buying from a third party rip off artist for and dont get the gb model for a few dollars less than the gb model,0
1663,lastly the size and weight,0
1664,try to boot off an external drive reboot go back into the bios settings under drive boot order and delete your external drive save,0
1665,works well but the limited system memory prevents me from using it as a daily driver,0
1666,my next laptop will be another dell and i will get it from tech for less if they have what i want in stock,0
1667,i have a regular screen,0
1668,a bit of a plastic feel to the touchpad and the keys are very light weight would prefer a bit more travel and weight but everything else is spot on,1
1669,my big test is the p frames per second video of mariokart,0
1670,if you are looking for something for medium everyday use and portability i would suggest looking elsewhere,1
1671,it is also missing a dvd drive if that matters to you,0
1672,i upgraded from an i with a regular harddrive,0
1673,the model served me faithfully as my daily carry for a years worth of lectures,0
1674,it has usb ports look like regular ports but theres a blue usb port on the left side,0
1675,previous zenbooks have come with several adapters user manuals warranty cards and a sleeve,0
1676,maybe that was hp i thought later i dont know but i had forgot they were calling me back and it was past hours,0
1677,after four hours of trying to accomplish this and another half hour with acer suppor who didnt even know what a pinch zoom was and had me repeat the same description to them ten times i boxed it back up and returned it,0
1678,it charges for me in use after about hours and less when its turned off,0
1679,either they had less memory or a slower speed or just was missing something,0
1680,my customer relations case manager did send an e mail stating that the repair team could not find an issue with the computer but a few days later,0
1681,enjoycrucial mx gb m internal solid state drive ctmxssd,0
1682,it would be great to have a pen input same as my touchsmart experienced lags when i opened more than tabs in google chrome and several wordexcel and pdf documents it would be great to have option to change battery for longer usage,1
1684,guess the problem is with this model of the p c because it was actually my second one with the same problem,0
1685,less than months into the school year some of the screws fell out,0
1686,the battery seemed to last all day no problem,0
1687,being an asus product id expect nothing less than a quality item,0
1688,also since i never use it as a tablet a toggle for the touch screen would be nice as ive touched it by accident when either cleaning it or using the keyboard while partially closed when attached via hdmi,1
1689,does everything a regular size computer does,0
1690,i should also note that the last of things that i cant do native on the chromebook i can do via platform as a service,0
1691,my battery died in less than two years,0
1692,it will be a solid computer for several years now,0
1694,i purchased item last year and just had to get another one,0
1695,really its not an issue for me since im not gon na buy a second battery but i think it would be nice to have it easily replaceable if something goes wrong,1
1696,it is a little slower than my alienware x i knew it would be but the graphics are quite nice in the game,1
1697,the series link below booted up in five seconds and awoke from sleep in less than two,0
1698,i put everything back to factory settings reset the computer from the beginning and still the same problem was happening,0

1705,so although this laptop has twice the memory as my last one it is not faster,0
1706,dec this is last years model yet u cant upgrade the memory,0
1707,i got a model like it last year,0
1708,if i had to pick one machine for always the way the computer press plays things it would always be the ginormous painful to haul laptop because i earn my dinner with my computers and while the cars are nice i need the truck,1
1709,ive used upwards of a dozen laptops in the last years and never had something like this happen,0
1710,the last item is because if you end up in command line mode thefont is unreadable,0
1711,battery does last hrs hopefully it continues like that,0
1713,it would be nice if rd party usb c hubs allowed for daisy chaining of upstream charging or on some allowed to charging at all you know who you are,1
1714,it works fantastically and is barely even trying when working and having multiple programs going,0
1715,if youre planning to use it as your replacement for taking notes and use the regular programs that you need for classes you might consider another computer instead,0
1716,now that it is gone i hope the computer is working more efficiently,1
1717,i ended up in chat and on the phone with these guys for well over an hour arguing over something that costs less than a stick of gum,0
1718,you can now place the plastic backing back on the laptop i found this easiest to start on the side with the blue usb ports and then align it the rest of the way,0
1719,digital images were not properly reproduced by the computer and after having it checked at a computer store there was no way to calibrate the colors,0
1720,sent it back for repairs but when it came back the solid state drive was missing,0
1721,after less than a year of use the headphone jack has crapped itself,0
1722,it was a bargain considering its a combination of a regular laptop pc and a touch screen,0
1723,given that this system lasted less than months i can not recommend the asus brand,0
1724,if theres an area the pro handles less well than the plus it seems to be memory management,0
1725,i have to pay self employment social security of and in addition i have to pay income tax on the vine items bringing it up to about overall taxation,0
1726,while asus admits they have the drives and that the drives work in this unit they refuse to sell them to the public and suggest that i buy another laptop that has one,0
1727,this item does not appear built to last,0
1729,even for regular laptop users it will suffice,0
1730,just a regular windows user since version,0
1731,i bought this computer less than months ago but now the battery is not working of the computer do not waste your money on this,0
1732,the only thing i wish it had was a status light built into the caps lock key or elsewhere so youd know if you inadvertently turned this on i do this occasionally and it would be nice to have a visual idiot light to alert me but this is really a very minor quibble,1
1733,no worries i can use the tb inch drive as external storage and back up,0
1734,i just opened the item to find the screen is not aligned properly with a gap on the left side,0
1735,when i switch from headphones to speakers a lot of the time the speakers dont work and i have to uninstall the audio driver restart it installs the same driver again then it doesnt work again later,0

1744,i went ahead and ordered it and the price went up a few days later,0
1745,of course this was outside of the return window so i looked into the warranty,0
1746,there are a few hardware specific hardware asus programs but they are useful,0
1747,the battery last about hours of over all i like the tablet,0
1748,overall it is a solid computer that does what i need it to do,0
1749,comtthinkpad edge s seriesre thinkpad s end insert button switched after last updatetd phighlighttrue,0
1750,the downside in less than two weeks she managed to crack the screen which is glass,0

1756,i have had dells last me years now and this piece of junk did not even make it a year,0
1757,it would be great if they lit up for a few seconds while you logged your access password,1
1758,of course this was less than a year after my hp laptop gave out,0
1759,when i ordered mine from dell i gave my less than a month olddell inspiron i slv inch touchscreen in laptop intel pentium gb ram gb hdd moonlight silver to my mom,0
1760,this has happened several times with this computer and after restarting a few times and typing into google it just wouldnt show me the site for some reason,0
1761,the battery lifetime is less than hours if its fully charges,0
1762,the update will take some time to install but when installed it will improve speed by about for startup and regular usage,0
1763,with the gb ram version i manage to have a few chrome apps like tweetdeck and google play music running at the same time while jumping between several tabs opened in the browser without any problems,0
1764,its not a gaming laptop but it would be a great student machine or for someone who doesnt have to have the absolute fastest processor etc,1
1765,overall the way i see it im getting a big screen hd android galaxy tablet with a keyboard for the price of a tablet,0
1766,update weeks later the second computer sent from amazon to replace the defective one gave the same hardware errors,0
1767,maybe previous comments i read were prior to a driver update,0
1768,dont buy one from last year youll get ripped off,0
1769,i am also experiencing the same issue on the replacement computer and debating if i need to send this back as well,0
1770,i left for several hours came back and it says chrome os is missing or damaged,0
1771,i have not tried the usb to ethernet but this laptop does have a mghz wifi which is faster and has less interference than the,0
1772,wasted hrs trying to trouble shoot with no success and returned product,0
1773,i built a custom gaming system around an intel core i k processor and a plextor me series gb m pcie internal solid state drive and an additional kingston hyperx k gb solid state drive and a seagate tb desktop hdd sata so im not hurting for storage,0
1774,the video card is gb of memory i would prefer but for the price it is not a bad compromise,1
1775,this is a really worth it laptop the monitor its frames back lot keyboard,0
1776,last battery life,0
1777,dont buy from asus they said the warranty is global which is a lie i contact them and said its international but doesnt apply outside us,0
1778,because of the last two differences the g has a hour battery capacity compared to hours for the g,0
1779,it would be nice if it were also touchscreen and the keypad mouse isnt ideal but that can be remedied by plugging in a mouse to one of the usb ports,1
1780,the feeling youre left with is that once they have your money asus will do the bare minimum to support their products thats just not going to cut it today,0
1781,i bought because of the star reviews and the price you get what you pay for and even less,0
1782,battery last about hours,0
1783,furthermore i told her i had bought my last acer computer from amazon,0
1784,battery issues after less than months computer doesnt charge anymore,0
1785,lastly pictures will not do this computer justice,0
1786,acer support will not cover this part in their warranty if you are a customer outside of the usa or canada,0
1787,it would be nice to have a separate app just to use it for recording,1
1788,called back customer service was told they will send me a prepaid shipping label but not packaging to mail computer in nor would they reimburse the i already spent on shipping computer,0
1789,tl dr the screws are looseboth the external casing and the internal hingeframe screws were not tightened,0

1791,less than a month later the computer would not even turn on,0
1792,bought this computer for myself and less than weeks later it doesnt even turn on,0
1793,motherboard died in less than a year,0
1794,the air i purchased was on sale and it was several hundred dollars less than the options with a retina display so that sealed the decision for me in going with the air,0
1795,spent over an hour with customer service barely speaks english,0
1796,net result was a solid recovery and plenty of storage with a number of apps metro and desktop about min,0
1797,overall i would recommend this laptop if youre on a budget and need an inexpensive computer or if you dont need too much power and would prefer to spend less,0
1798,a no brainer at but i can see it being worth the regular price as well,0
1799,this is the last time i will ever go for this type deal at amazon again,0
1800,when i bought it i didnt realize just how annoying it would be to have to have to use the function key and the arrow keys every time i wanted to change the volume,1
1801,i bought this because i needed a computer to write my senior thesis paper on and my regular laptop was on the fritz after the windows update,0
1802,its a shame that i am returning this product because i thought it would last me a while,0
1803,can you get a computer with the same specs for less,0
1804,and thus acer won hopefully this was useful information if you were wondering how much extra this dedicated graphics card brings to the table,0
1805,i would have to disagree about that number with regular usage,0
1806,this is outside of the month return timeframe so my next step will be to contact lenovo to see if they can help,0
1808,the specs said hours of battery life but mine runs out in less than two hours with just basic usage,0
1809,less than one year after purchase the battery no longer works and i must keep it plugged in at all times for it to receive power,0
1810,i saw the led flash red a few times let the button go and the led switched to white,0
1811,broke screen less than a week,0
1812,this missing usb port is intregal to the performance of this computer,0
1813,this is probably the perfect computer to give to a senior it just works at what it does has no security issues and is far better built than the price would suggest,1
1814,when i came back to the computer i noticed that it had restarted and when i tried to move the mouse the screen turned blue although not bsod blue and had groupings of white artifacts all over the screen,0
1815,rather than get another desktop i wanted something less bulky for my apartment and decided on a laptop,0
1816,i had to upload a few cleaning programs to bring it back together,0
1817,tried to contact asus as its still under warranty but connection was refused on their internal message center,0
1818,i used an external disk drive to install my culinary software and copied rcipes and music over,0
1819,i bought the computer for my son and in less than two months its not working,0
1820,depending on what you are doing the battery will last you about hours,0
1821,i type over words per minute and im not getting any missing keystrokes at all,0
1822,however in less than months the battery wont charge,0
1823,but for the rest of what we all do on our computers every day read the internet engage with social networking watch videos on the web swap and interact with basic file types this thing is supreme,0
1824,i can not wait to see where computers like this go over the next few years,0
1825,i hadnt opened it since my last update and the battery now is at,0
1826,it will last longer than advertised hours,0
1827,my last gaming entry laptop sony vaio lasted me over yrs and counting,0
1828,i dont think battery will last the hrs,0
1829,overall this is a very solid gaming computer and it should handle anything you throw at it,0
1830,i had problem with the battery it last not to longer,0
1831,i had a hp amd laptop for the last years and when it came time to upgrade i purchased another one,0
1832,i ordered two of these and both had the same problem namely aggravating loss of function on the left mouse buttondead cmos battery that i had to replace myself,0
1833,it may be i missed a few drivers i hope but this is a serious problem to me,1
1834,cons battery life is still less than i would have imagined,0
1835,ditch your proprietary power cord make a trackpad that functions of the time and make the battery last longer,0
1836,also it uses less power and puts off almost zero heat,0
1837,for the slight power users out there that would like to add memory and capacity to their machine you do have the ability to add a hdd to the gb ssd and another ddr ram stick slots present with gb stick as it comes,0
1838,i uninstalled some programs and reinstalled windows multiple times until one day it started crashing constantly blue screen,0
1839,i have had dell support try to fix the above issues several times now and no luck,0
1840,next day blue screen again same issue,0
1841,within the second week this computer had the blue screen of death,0
1842,this makes a portable computer less portable,0
1843,the ram however is not upgradeable but i didnt think it worth another to get the next model up that had the gb of ram,0
1844,i found and ordered the asus zb pro on amazon prime now same specs extra usb plus the k touchscreen for less than the dell no touchscreen no k and still less and within about hours,0
1845,we have had this computer for months and of course you cant send it back because that window has closed,0
1846,i had the computer less than month was still trying to set everything up,0
1847,dont buy killer wifi adapter stopped working in less than hours of use,0
1848,im sure it would be nice to have dual p touch screens but then youve got two screens to keep clean,1
1850,i found this t from esales connect it was the last one they had in stock at the time of my purchase,0
1851,but it crashed garbled purple screen on the second day i had it and after less than a week now freezes fairly regularly,0
1852,since a portion of my free time is recording music it would be great if it did that but it doesnt and that is fine,1
1853,at the end of the third year the battery had to be replaced and the logic board was starting to have issues with wifi connection,0
1854,ive had this computer less than a week,0
1855,charge time from lows around remaining life to is a bit less than hours,0
1856,all was well until a half hour later when my son said it turned off,0
1857,one caveat after getting used to these speeds you can never go back to using regular computers,0
1858,i will not be purchasing an asus product ever again as this experience has left a sour taste in my mouth,0
1859,also on my spotify account i can no longer drag playlists or songs and re arrange them,0
1860,slimness of design is no excuse for lack of a swapable ram module,0
1861,i still occasionally have problems with the mouse however the cursor will literally disappear from the screen i have no idea where it goes the digital void,0
1862,it was the change i was looking for after dealing with pcs for the last years,0
1863,i wasnt expecting very much for the amount of money but honestly a computer at this price should be able to open up a computer program like google chrome or microsoft word in under three minutes,1
1864,the uxca wont stay in portrait view and constantly wants to switch back to landscape while re enabling the keyboard and trackpad,0
1865,i bought one for my wife last year,0
1866,i wont bore you with specs but between the cell dell and cell lenovo there is less time on battery,0
1867,my last computer i have had for years still works but cant be updated anymore because its an apple,0
1868,thanks the good product well packaged protected when arrived could probably throw the box down a flight of stairs and it the laptop would be fine within stays very cool ran a stress test and heavy gaming processor topped out at c gpu also well within limits optimus works fine only places needed programs on discrete graphics otherwise used integrated camera is pretty nice not super hq but nice screen is plenty bright indoors not sure what a lot of people were complaining about backlight not overpowering on keyboard chiclet like keyboard very comfortable to type on full number pad but keys are laid out differently elbo power cable bluetooth,1
1869,the price of this laptop is about less than what comparable machines are,0
1870,it also supports navigating forward and back with two fingers although this gesture is definitely less responsive than with apples trackpad,0
1871,this is the second time i have bought one of these last time it was the gb and it was installed on a pc,0
1872,edit i had been having issues with my showing up in my computer after waking from sleep that started a few months back,0
1873,one would like to think that asus support would know this or that they would be updating their drivers as intel updates the generic version,1
1874,i guess it will last for hrs based on my usage internet surfing youtube facebook typing stuff and amazon shopping of course,0
1875,the computer started acting up less than six months from purchase,0
1876,it does have a con for me battery doesnt last hours of illustrating on a row for me,0
1878,it would be wonderful to have a backlit keyboard even though it would shorten the laptops battery life,1
1879,if you have last years model with the dedicated graphics card depending on what you use it for it may not be worth the upgrade,0
1880,i switched to apple products after years of cursing windows and android based systems spending on two macbook pros and an iphone c within the last year,0
1881,i bought my hp on line from one of the shopping channels last month my dell had lost its color and everything on the screen is red after years,0
1882,i have a lot of chromebooks and i have purchased acer cs since the release last year,0
1883,no doubt this will last me a couple years,0
1884,con upgrade to windows lost auto switch from inside screen to outside screen,0
1885,so after minutes of waiting and thinking i was experiencing the same issue with this asus laptop i powered it off turned it back on again,0
1886,it would be a great gift to someone who needs a computer or as a second to go computer,1
1887,theres a few options with gb cards and ips displays for less money,0
1888,any alternate boot from an external usb device done at the bios level will display in portrait mode instead of in landscape mode,0
1889,this gives me less than hours depending on how im using it,0
1890,do not buy this computer windows on updated the computer using the windows update service updated the graphics drivers causing the computer to blue screen with the video scheduler internal error,0
1891,i have already recommended this hp stream x to several friends and do recommend this hybrid with its limited memory,0
1892,i just started gaming the last two years lotro,0
1893,it would be nice if the case had smaller access panels to you can access the hd memory and the wifi card with out disassembling the computer case,1
1894,i would suggest avoiding razer products at all costs the company as a whole cares very little for their customers my story i purchased a razer blade and after approximately a year pretty much immediately after the base warranty ended the power adapter stopped being recognized by the system and thus the battery would not charge,1
1895,never owned an apple product before but i realized as soon as i started using this thing that i had been missing out,0
1896,i just bought a powerline adapter so i can wire in the xbox one and hopefully thatll get it up to speed,1
1897,it will maybe last hours without you having to recharge,0
1898,thats less than my hp dx weighed without its battery,0
1899,it would be easier to simply use android have access to all the apps or the other and there have been rumors that they merge unlikely but possible,1
1900,i wish the screen was ips but for this price point i was able to get gb vs which my advisor said would improve the performance,1
1901,programs crash regularly,0
1902,the battery life of this inspiron just last for to hours maximum,0
1903,its my daily grinder and will continue to be for a couple more years hopefully,1
1904,this computer had about gb less storage space than advertised,0
1905,my other concern was that it would be slow but i have been able to have over a dozen tabs open and continue to work at full speed,1
1906,even last years toshiba xg was faster than the xg,0
1907,the screen at inches is actually a big difference over a ten inch tablet screen,0
1908,not what you want when youve had it for less than hours,0
1909,i dont know what id do if it had happened well outside of warranty,0
1910,all of this in less than two hours,0
1911,i already have an asus c that i bought last year,0
1912,it would be nice if there was a cover of some sort to protect the keyboard,1
1913,then just outside of warranty the screen cracked,0
1915,for the last couple of months hes had issues with the screen freaking out as he says,0
1916,were this my daily use system id have an external keyboard at the office to use anyway so it wouldnt be a big deal,0
1917,it would be nice to have ssd drive but actually the stock drive works really well just slower boot ups is all i have really noticed,1
1918,occasionally the screen goes blank for a minute and a message appears that there was a driver issue again not often and hasnt been a big deal,0
1920,in performance i cant complain of this computer i can do some gaming with no worry of overheat because of its big fans in the back,0
1921,i bought a macbookpro it did not even last year,0
1922,this one just barely last years before the connection from the battery to the cord went bust,0
1923,the next day there was a blank screen last for about seconds when i use my computer to a drawing then the system prompted display driver stopped responding and has recovered,0
1924,less an owners manual or any type of recovery disk or flash drive,0
1925,i even plug chromebooks in to the projectors in the classroom both the samsung and acer cb have hdmi out instead of using the less reliable windows desktop computers that are built into the class,0
1926,a computer should be able to be dependable for more than months,1
1927,if i want to spend the second half of my day in the backyard working or the living room it will hold charge for those hours with no issues,0
1928,my last was a samsung with an i and screen,0
1929,battery would last about hours,0
1930,i call back and repair system is down called back a few days later again and they say they are out of parts to fix it,0
1931,they sent me a ups mailing label and we will be returning it for a refund less the restocking fee,0
1932,if you still have a system image backup from another computer and want to try keep all your installed applications intact instead of reinstalling all from scratch then here goes note my previous laptop was an hp pavilion from several years ago,0
1933,the increased ram and intel processor ensures that its going to last a while unlike the arm processor thats in the hp,0
1934,theres also a screw hole under a very generic looking warranty voiding sticker from what ive read it doesnt actually void the warranty if you remove the sticker to get to the screw,0
1935,my last laptop i had was a tba from bt by theres your brain teaser for the day and the screen started screwing up a couple months after the warranty ran out,0
1936,as a result i dont expect the power supply to last,0
1937,cons crappy generic ssd not even worth being nvme at the readwrite speeds it offers,0
1938,it was purchased for my father for christmas and within months the screen was freezing blue or white,0
1939,the pc then ran well for the next couple months but then i started getting blue screens out of nowhere,0
1940,i love the product but got it in terrible condition and disappointed in customer servicei would like to let you know that im really upset with the products i got from jr,1
1941,not something id expect with a battery that is supposed to last hours,0
1942,when i saw this laptop advertised with a windows operating system at less than for the basic model i knew this was going to be my official school laptop,0
1943,if you decide to purchase this computer i hope you have better luck with it than i have,1
1944,locks up daily with a blue screen,0
1945,whether it is for you depends on your needs but for me this laptop replaces quite a few devices that i would otherwise need to do what i want to do whether it is for programming in visual studio gaming reading news writing emails reading books on kindle handwritten note taking in meetings on onenote etc,0
1946,is this the last computer i ever buy,0
1947,in photoshop cc the text is not workable with the regular display view,0
1948,well intel core i u and gb of rams should be able to handle most of the applications ive run on a daily basis,1
1949,my wife is a photographer as well and this computer just doesnt have the space for storing the tens of thousands of photos she has generated over the last years,0
1950,the battery life on battery saving mode will get less than minutes worth and the power dc jack has already blown once,0
1952,retina lbsi could also eliminate the price and ram criteria now since all models were gb and price variation was less than model storage battery display weight pro gb hrs,0
1953,if you do not use it for entertainment it can last around hours,0
1954,third party sellers cant be trusted in my years experience as a regular amazon customer,0
1955,ive owned this laptop since july of last year,0
1956,screen broke by itself literally closed it and opened it next morning,0
1957,had to call apple and spent hours trying to fix now have to send back and daughter has no computer for college,0
1958,i was told it would be processed in hours however weeks later when i hadnt yet received it i called asus to inquire about the charger and they told me they didnt have that information,1
1959,it would be nice if at this price they provided a carraige for the case,1
1960,not minutes later the blue screen showed up again and the computer restarted,0
1961,read reviews on hp support and tens of folks having same issue and need to send it back,0
1962,college studentage gameroccasional social mediaphotoshopother adobe appsmicrosoft word excel powerpoint etc,0
1963,the last time i had to use power wash i put google in the trash,0
1964,i bought this for my husband so its not as big of a deal but if id bought it for me id send it back asap,0
1965,i would recommend this computer to anyone that uses a computer on a regular basis,0
1966,it less memory and lower cpu then the hp i have now,0
1967,i get about hrs in regular usage flipping between movies gaming and productivity,0
1968,according to tech support you could install another gb memory in same standard and install ssd drives as raid,0
1969,the screen is still showing on the outside screen,0
1970,this will probable be the last dell product that i will ever buy,0
1971,charges with a universal usb cable which means that my mwh external battery charger will work to charge my iphone ipad and now the asusthe battery life,0
1972,i wouldnt buy another dell product if their laptop is going to last less than a year,0
1973,in my field of professional music i need to know that i am connected by ethernet hardwire to the outside world,0
1974,this samsung pro series gb is one of the fastest internal solid state drives ive tested and comes with a year warranty,0
1975,i have had this computer less than a year,0
1976,i dont like a mouse pad using a usb wireless mouse and the touch screen and i keep my song music library on a usb external tb drive so when i back up i dont eat up a lot of time and back up drive space,0
1977,they said the third party company they send these to for repairs deemed ours physically damaged and the warranty was void,0
1978,it would be nice to have the physical volume control option laid out easier to adjust,1
1979,ive spent the last five hours running diagnostics to get it working again,0
1980,windows runs somewhat unstable on my device as i am experience multiple blue screen crashes and the touchscreen failing to register gestures,0
1981,i would have the laptop turned at and have it at after after half an hour of working on my desktop i would go back on the laptop and see it at or,0
1982,this is the last model with dvd drive,0
1983,the battery does not last,0
1984,on the local site its not even advertised update the nearest service center that i could find on the international website turned out to be a garbage recycling facility,0
1985,my biggest complaint is that the on off switch is on the left side of the laptop and i have to life it to find the button to depress it to turn it on or restart it after its gone to sleep,0
1986,it keeps dropping wifi all the time it stopped playing sounds because of a missing driver we had to re install it,0
1987,being that it has an arm processor i wish there was a way to install android on it and run it off of the same linux kernel so one can switch back and forth between the two without having to restart,1
1988,after being asked the same questions three times the automated system told me it would connect me to a rep then i got another recording which told me to try again later and hung up,0
1989,dont laugh on some netbooks and even notebooks the viewing angles can be so limited that even if your head is centered relative to the screen some part of the screen will be shaded washed out or diffracted,0
1990,i think the last non glossy screen i used was my desktop computer back in the day,0
1991,this should make a solid daily use laptop for me for several years provided i remain cognizant of its limitations and take care of it,0
1992,several hours later it was still the same way,0
1993,i thought it was a regular size laptop but thats my fault,0
1994,so far this laptop is the perfect computer to replace my aging year old asus gaming laptop it had dedicated graphics too and hopefully it will serve me for another years,1
1995,i have a few days left and i think im going to return this computer,0
1996,if you like alt tabing and running things in the background like tv shows or what not the computer can get a bit bogged and hold up for a second,0
1997,i was on the internet and downloading software on this laptop for over hours the last two days and the battery is still on,0
1998,one moment it says theres ten hours of charge left and the next it goes down to three,0
1999,besides the battery life is less than hours,0
2000,after it asked me for some info it took me back to the same screen,0
2001,honestly though there are circumstances it would be nice to have the rear camera such as when you want to put a picture in your onenotes but since onenotes is free your phone camera still works for this as well,1
2002,after min run time after initial power up and not opening any programs the cpu is still running at or close to it every few seconds,0
2003,it would be nice to leave the key board attached to the power and just detach the screen for use,1
2004,my computer has stayed with me less than its traveled to them,0
2005,ive actually been using the touch screen while taking notes in class actually quite useful,0
2006,this just in if youre using or and congratulating yourself know that said telemetry snooping features capturing every last keyboard stroke and reporting in has just been added as a feature to and,0
2007,like others have said the screen is garbage and stops working in less than a year,0
2008,im fed up with the laptop and i requested a return last two times the disk cleanup has started working,0
2009,theres only a single usb connection it would be nice to have one or two more although the one can obviously be bridged and theres an hdmi output,1
2010,a few initial thoughts after having it for five days the cpu was a big area of concern for me,0
2011,contacted acer predator dedicated support i am told that the kits have been missing in some computers and are shipped separately on request,0
2012,the display drive regularly reboots or the computer restarts,0
2013,the last fix was to get the matte cover off the screen,0
2014,it turns out this was a hardware issue and therefore i had to send this back less than weeks after purchase,0
2015,here are my pros and cons pros very fast with the i and ssd this baby is super fast it boots up in about seconds screen is amazing hard not to when vizio is a lead competitor in the tv market sleek and thin this thing is very thin and fairly light yet feels durable because of the aluminum case cons being so thin the speakers are not very loud because they are obviously not very big the keys on the keyboard take some getting used to windows it would be nice if it was a touch screen but with windows gestures its easy to get the hang of it,1
2016,when i call back they tell me that a member of that department will call me at a specific day and time and then i get no call,0
2017,less than one star computer easly damaged and they wont do anything about it,0
2018,when im at school with the fully charged battery and turn it on battery saver the battery will last well over hours,0
2019,when i last checked the asus website page for this computer i didnt see any mention of the resized sd card slot or the addition to the keyboard,0
2020,i cant think of anything else to review but i already know about chromebooks since ive had one since last year,0
2021,there is no standard external monitor port and not even an adapter included,0
2022,attached a dvd rom external drive visit usb and still no success,0
2023,my laptop arrived without any paperwork so i was missing the one year office and tb onedrive storage offer,0
2024,i have spent several hours on the phone with them attempting to troubleshoot and nothing has worked,0
2025,for basic internet surfing the battery tends to last about hours for me with the screen brightness to about,0
2026,they proceeded to ship the missing parts to me and told me that id have to install them myself,0
2027,i have had this for about months and the screen cracked making it so i can not use the touch screen i wish i could just buy a new screen and replace it but i can not find any,1
2028,the screen might have a lower resolution than the one on the samsung chromebook pro but for less you get twice the storage and a backlit keyboard so this was a no brainer for me,0
2029,its worth the to upgrade since youre investing in gb ram anyway why waste it,0
2030,i have owned my chromebook for less than years and my initial opinion was that it was useful for its lightweight portability,0
2031,yet i have had some wifi issues over the last year with lenovo and had read about wifi issues with the yoga,0
2032,if it goes in less than to years im done with toshiba,0
2033,id use it all the time but ive never gotten the hang of typing on a laptop style keyboard yes i know i can dock a wireless keyboard to it but i have space issues where i use this to study and to type the simplest thing takes me forever unless im in front of a regular keyboard,0
2034,a few hours later the screen did not show i contacted asus,0
2035,on a screen of this quality you would expect nothing less than perfection much less the price,0
2036,last night my wifi dropped i tried to reconnect and it said there were no wireless routers within range,0
2037,booting computer went from like seconds to less than,0
2038,regular updates would take hours according to the laptop,0
2040,three and half years later it stopped working not powering on at all,0
2041,the screen already internally cracked in less than month of having it,0
2042,this is unacceptable for any computer much less one in this price range,0
2043,charger stopped working less than a year after purchase,0
2044,it is being returned for a regular sized and reliable laptop,0
2045,i went away for a few hours and came back to a repaired machine,0
2046,i keep track of all kinds of stuff surf social plus ive built lots of docs using drive,0
2047,i would never buy a big ticket item off the net again,0
2048,a week and a half later i recieved and it work for a week and now back to the same blue screen,0
2049,purchased of these over the last years,0
2050,so i sold my last macbook i still use mac mini at home and tried this rugged but lightweight chromebook,0
2051,it comes preinstalled with windows which is a winner much less jarring to the windows user than or,0
2052,battery last for a while,0
2053,it rivals my all solid state drive macbook in terms of overall speed,0
2054,my model has gb ram tb hdd and a gb ssd th gen i processor and a mid range dedicated graphics card all for less than,0
2055,even then though using hibernate when it comes back up it still blue screens about of the time,0
2056,it would be a great computer if it didnt,1
2057,hopefully more downloads will be available in the future,1
2058,my chromebook only has gb of memory and while that is probably more than enough for a chromebook since the idea is to store everything in the cloud it would be nice to know that i might be able to download a few movies if i needed to,1
2059,less than a year and i started having problems with the unit not always turning on,0
2060,it would be nice to be able to watch some videos from a flash drive when internet is unavailable,1
2061,when i was searching around for extra ram for my imac mid i came across this product,0
2062,i am one who prefers glossy displays and this one has no antiglare coating but its not unusable outside either,0
2063,it may be worth noting that the color of the logo on the back seems to not be adjustable stays red for me as i thought it would automatically change to whatever color the keyboard was set to be,0
2064,go back to previous programs for those who do not wish to interact with their computers as tablets and use this program for your tablets,0
2065,i spent hours online with the dell technician and had to send back to dell for repairs they replaced the screen,0
2066,this is my second one got it because it does everything the big guys do and its portable,0
2067,this is the last time i will ever buy a computer through amazon,0
2068,it is less than the price of fixing her laptop,0
2069,i think a laptop should last longer than a year when you pay for it,0
2070,in less than ten seconds i have this thing powered up and surfing the internet or doing whatever else i want it to do,0
2071,ive tested the internet on multiple speed test sites and they all return the same results,0
2072,so my plan is to have it repaired and covered by amex and hopefully it will last for another few years,1
2073,if you have even the tiniest of problems you will enter the vortex of hell that is dells excuse for customer service,0
2074,occasionally this computer with disable the internet and you cant get it back on until you uninstall and then let it re install,0
2075,however the internal wireless modem stopped working a week after i bought it and i had to buy an external usb modelm to access internet,0
2076,moving from a windows based laptop to this has me missing skype calls and i cant run a specific program from my school to set up a vpn,0
2077,it would be nice to know the reason for the screen to change like it did,1
2078,the service was just outside of my price range,0
2079,this is last product of hp for me,0
2080,so less time i can bill them for waiting for my computer to boot up the happier they are as well,0
2081,i remember the day when people brought products built to last,0
2082,edited paragraph on my last day before shipping the computer back it got stuck on a continuous bootload,0
2083,received this product today and when it was powered up it said the operating system was damaged or missing,0
2084,playing games on the battery will last you maybe an hour,0
2085,lastly i would add something about the screen,0
2086,this newer model freezes multiple times daily is actually slower,0
2087,it would be a great first computer for a student maybe a gift for someone who just needs to browse the web and send email but it just wasnt quite enough for me,1
2088,even after a year the battery will last for hours and sometimes up to or if i lower the brightness setting,0
2089,i spent several hours reloading my apps to the samsung pro,0
2090,at this point just a few fairly standard programs had been installed minecraft and skype,0
2091,i received the product last week,0
2092,i was intrigued by the capability to add a second ssd via the additional sata port and although i have yet to do so i will be adding a second drive in the future,0
2093,i had to move some files off to a second drive to make room for it but that was well worth it and i dont need picture files on my ssd,0
2094,but the trade off is less power consumption and a cooler running machine,0
2095,i still use a macbook air and find it slowcumbersome pushing harder in corners or trying to drag objects with the trackpad,0
2096,i spent several hours on the phone with both microsoft customer service as well as dell,0
2097,the battery would last an hour as i inched out of a year,0
2098,it powers up in seconds or less,0
2099,the thing charges completely in less than hours and my experience has been that it holds a charge anywhere between and hours depending on what you are doing,0
2100,if you are buying this computer i hope you have a taste for lemon juice cuz thats what mine tastes like,1
2101,the one downside to me is that the screen is almost unusable outside,0
2102,my recommendation buy the same spec laptop from cyberpowerpc minus the raid for to less monies or get this with the gtx,0
2103,been using this since the last years with no problems,0
2104,i did not used the acer blue screen protection as colors were disturbed and screen became yellow in appearance,0
2105,prosamazing screen qualitycan it handle adobe programs several at the same time,0
2106,when i recreate my google account on the machine all the previously installed apps come back automatically,0
2107,so i returned the last hp pavilion chromebook because it died upon updating chrome os the system asks you to do so,0
2108,barely usable without a second display,0
2109,i used the warranty on my last computer and it saved me lots of money,0
2110,so after a lengthy talk with technical support i send it back in wait another week and get it back,0
2111,the computer boots up in less than seconds,0
2112,blinking keyboard i have a yoga pro and just outside of warranty it stopped working,0
2113,now who use regular computer,0
2114,there is no excuse to pay close to dollars and have just a crappy product,0
2115,with windows even an average user should be able to reinstall windows on their own now,1
2116,one thing im keen on is that you can actually charge the laptop via the usb type c port also a thunderbolt port on the left side,0
2117,one thing this really is missing is a ethernet port,0
2118,i started getting a blue screen of death daily now,0
2119,the flip feature is neat and useful but the touchscreen alone is worth the price for those moments youd rather just flick the screen or tap than use the keyboard,0
2120,beyond the physical hardware itself i find nothing useful about the chromebook design at all,0
2121,its raised in the back with venting and fan for cooling the inner parts,0
2122,it gave a blue screen error about a missing device and listed keys to press to troubleshoot the problem,0
2123,i will no longer go with asus considering this is the second replacement computer with the same issue,0
2124,decided to go with this computer for her browsing youtube email social networking bill pay etc,0
2125,its incredibly easy and relatively quick and with chrome rdp hopefully gaining compatibility in r the experience may even be better,1
2126,the laptop is still working great except that i wish this model had a kensington security lock slot to hold a security lock cable,1
2127,you could buy an i equipped rocket for less money but twice the weight,0
2128,using google docs and google drive i have no need for my regular pc,0
2129,my child has had this computer less than months and already she is having problem with the mouse pad,0
2130,or rather opposite of how you would drag a touch screen,0
2131,edit laptop battery wear level is already at after less then a couple years and the battery dies off the charger in less than minutes,0
2132,got this for christmas last year for college,0
2133,my last computer took over a minute,0
2134,i am switching from a macbook air after using it exclusively for the last years,0
2135,overall this laptop really worth this price,0
2136,called in a computer service company and was told to send it back because the processor will not function properly,0
2137,less than a year before it is on its last leg,0
2138,and because of that this will be my last lenovo product,0
2139,my regular computer is a mac mini,0
2140,opened and closed the screen multiple times,0
2141,i think this laptop will definitely last us years,0
2142,i bought this last year,0
2143,didnt last a year,0
2144,overall it is not worth the price,0
2145,i wish the screen could be rotated further back and the power cord to be longer,1
2146,i have adjusted the power settings in an attempt to make it last longer,0
2147,you cant install programs outside of browser plug ins,0
2148,with the solid state drive and the fan less cpu there are no moving parts to wear out,0
2149,its a beautiful laptop the design and material are top notch is super fast i love the display i would like that have a extra usb port but its okay i recommend anyone to buy it,1
2150,battery lifeapple claims hours to a charge compared with hours on last years model,0
2151,ive had this chromebook for less than a year,0
2152,why was it on there and other non essential stupid programs explored w some sucky bits there but hey its microsoft whaddya want im gon na curse under my breath or loudly depending on any more issues there because we hates it my precious namely setting default programs for file types it wouldnt let me choose from programs only what it thinks is logical grrrr now loading the one game that i hope to really test out the graphics card on hopefully it will be a nice surprise should be since this is an upgrade from my old lappy,1
2153,if there were truly any complaints i have had with this laptop it would have to be that the included bloatware can be fairly annoying if not uninstalled not truly the laptops fault but when mcafee constantly asks you to pay up then youll understand what i mean booting for the first time as well as coming off of sleep mode can drag on sometimes roughly seconds thanks to the hdd and the webcam is one of the absolute worse webcams i have ever seen,1
2154,you can put a micro sd card in the chromebook for extra internal storage although im just relying on google drive at the moment,0
2155,now it is too soon to know if they are going to be a problem but a tip from the digital camera that my wife has small rubber plugs attached to the body that you pop out and they stay attached until you are done would be nice and keep the look clean when everything is covered and protected,1
2156,hopefully customer service can send a working product,1
2157,it would be nice if they similarly provided a more thorough guide to all the features on the chromebook such as the camera which i still havent figured out,1
2158,but if the product doesnt work seamlessly out of the box im not going to waste my time trying to troubleshoot it over an outsourced customer relationship line,0
2159,battery life significantly less than stated,0
2160,also had issues with the display just outside of warranty,0
2161,while it would be nice to have microsoft office on here i can do everything i need for school through google docs,1
2162,however if you do your research and know what this product is i would still give it a star rating if i paid regular price,0
2163,they also offer the ability to watch hulu and netflix with subscriptions not included and use social media,0
2164,last computer i bought was an asus problematic as it was a desktop and tech support in india,0
2165,the system boots fully in less than fifteen seconds,0
2166,the windows home edition isnt too big a deal as a home user the added benefits of the pro version are few but it would be nice to have an upgrade option,1
2167,avoid this laptop the last one i had was a i and it even ran a d modeling program this one can not even handle adobe reader properly,0
2168,the and inch versions have the same internal hardware cpu ram emmc storage,0
2169,supposed to be warrantied for a year but they yelled at me and told me its days and hung up on me last time i called,0
2170,lastly is the color of the laptop,0
2171,for example i charged to and less than an hour later it was already at,0
2172,i monitored the battery status during that time and i think it did last through about hours of use plus the standby,0
2173,probably my last hp product ever,0
2174,i wish the screen were a little brighter,1
2175,this is a solid and reliable choice for a regular laptop user,0
2176,i cant tell if this is actually a model as i cant confirm that dell updated this computer since its initial release,0
2177,i am a few months out of warranty so it will be several hundred dollars to fix,0
2178,secondly like any computer it will need to be restarted occasionally to do anything,0
2179,overall i believe the computer was worth the purchase,0
2180,after researching for about a month for one with a dedicated graphics card that would last me for several years i threw this one into my wishlist and settled on saving for it,0
2181,the battery is rated to last hours,0
2182,we watch tv and movies mainly via streaming so i thought that it would be nice to have my laptop back while my daughter is watching cartoons on netflix,1
2183,subsequently my operating system microsoft office applications and all games have been loaded to my gb ssd,0
2184,i have been trying to install the upgrade windows for the last hours,0
2185,i had to order a second one of these because the first one was password protected this one has no camera and sometimes i think it is going to crash as the screen flickers however the price was what i could afford and it is so far working fine and hopefully it will last for a couple years like my last refurb did,1
2186,its not a gaming powerhouse but he does manage to run some less graphically intensive games on it with no problem,0
2187,last month i decided to give my mobile pcs a rest not to mention my batterieshot battery killing my cell phones,0
2188,i bought this computer last year just started using it,0
2189,i have been charging this computer for the last hours and the battery is still at,0
2190,less than a year ago i purchased this microsoft surface product,0
2191,i had windows on the previous computer but this is probably a later version,0
2192,but it says it is missing google chrome which it should have already been installed and now it says to missing or damaged,0
2193,battery at brightness the battery will last hours,0
2194,i got this laptop last year when it just got launched,0
2195,i have left it for hours and still the same,0
2196,it vents the heat onto the screen but the upper bottom half of the laptop also heats up,0
2197,it would be nice to have a cddvd driver built in for downloads and movie viewing,1
2198,after the initial boot up it spent several hours trying to update itself,0
2199,my computer goes from the desktop to reboot and back to desktop in less than seconds now,0
2200,ive bought this chromebook when i was last week in england and i was leaving from luton airport,0
2201,the verdict on this is that it would be great for someone that doesnt need it to watch videos or use this for heavy entertainment,1
2202,im working on a book and three times within the last month the computer crashed,0
2203,i see them on ebay and amazon for hundreds less for newer models,0
2204,our basic needs web browsing hd video playback social media media center,0

2215,sent back within a few hours of receiving,0

2219,for those of you complaining this thing cost less than a cell phone,0
2220,well i bought this computer for my son less than months ago,0
2221,i have watched this laptop over the last months and the price has fluctuated from about and,0
2222,that being said it would be great if producers of pc products could figure out how to combine powerful hardware and high quality components namely keyboards and trackpads,1
2223,neither of these issues are deal breakers however if i begin to use the laptop away from home more often it would be nice to have something with a longer battery life,1
2224,only have two gripes i wish it had backlit keys and i wish the screen could tilt back just a little more,1
2225,the chromebook generally does all of those things and if it worked consistently it would be a great low cost computer for what it was designed to do,1
2226,for surfing the web doing research and keeping in touch with friends via social media there is nothing out there that will do what this will for the price,0
2227,system board went out in less than weeks,0

2236,second asus pc need to b returned not operating properly,0
2237,but i doubt it will last hours even doing nothing,0
2238,the charger is about the size of most other chargers tho so that is a bonuspro gameplay smooth running on max settings as long as u tweak the resolution as mentioned wonderful touch pad and keyboard speakers that are loud enough and clear build quality almost up to par with apple and far better than anyother laptop of this caliber great portability with its slim design and lightweight wireless seems to work very well anything else u might be wondering about that i have not yet mentionedall in all a very solid build accompanied with solid all round performance must admit i think its worth every penny although hopefully in next years model they offer a p non touch matte display version with a gpu,1
2239,no ones computer should last a month,0
2240,it may even last longer if i put it on battery saver,0
2241,this is my school social media and gaming computer all in one,0
2242,installation was a breeze taking less than minutes with zero compatibility issues,0
2243,i bought this computer less than years ago,0
2244,after less than an hour of play cpu and gpu temps were in the s celsius,0
2245,the nd toshibas from last year,0
2246,i dont like working on anything less than a screen but dont want a bulky laptop to carry around,0
2247,this acer chromebook is quite a deal for less than with an inch screen gb of ddrl sdram memory gb of internal storage and a intel celeron n dual core processor,0
2248,disclaimer ive been running macs exclusively for the last years and have not touched a windows computer since windows xp sp so you might consider me to be an apple fan boy,0
2249,it died after less than a year,0
2250,go to last tab and boot override using the usb drive containing ubuntu,0
2251,bought this laptop before christmas and have had blue screen of death daily,0
2252,but a few months later after the warranty expired the charging problem returned,0
2253,its like google is trying to protect the user from outside influences,0
2254,the mbps extra screen size does not enable it to accommodate a third document,0
2255,everybody was pointing at last years model the cb or the acer chromebook,0
2256,i did have a hiccup day one the driver for my touch pad was out of date or missing,0
2257,this literally makes me wan na work harder,0
2258,bought it last year for christmas,0
2259,the quality is decent not quite the apple level but neither is the price so for this year i hope the acer will suffice and we see what might come later,1
2260,screen left half has problems,0
2261,im and have basically lived on the internet for school work and socializing for the last years,0
2263,in my case it is not an issue since i am not sitting outside using this computer,0
2264,batterypower the battery is supposed to last for hours,0
2266,no big deal when in notebook mode but if i go to back to tablet mode it will be locked in the landscape orientation and not go back to portrait orientation,0
2267,update the gpu uninstalled itself again and that was the last straw for my wife,0
2268,we ordered a matching ddr gb memory stick and western digital gb m solid state stick to go with it,0
2269,i was able to block hopefully forever the metro screen where i will not be purchasing anything,1
2271,when we were finished we closed the computer and put it back on the charger,0
2272,the next time this model goes down to that price level i may buy a second one,0
2273,toshiba diagnosed the problem as internal damage to the screen resulting from an external force applied to the screen i e dropping device stepping on it,0
2274,now the chromebook wont boot and shows the chrome os is missing or damaged screen when powered on,0
2275,the trackpad is clumsy but hopefully future hardware updates fix this,1
2276,while it has gb memory a card reader would be great to expand or exchange files but alas not,1
2277,overall its worth the price but do get antivirus protection,0
2278,windows can be a bit of a pain as can some of the hardware design quirks but overall im finding it to be a solid performer,0
2279,it has a number pad on the keyboard which a smaller laptop would not have gb of ramcons battery life could be better but to accomplish this the manufacturer would probably have to trim performance,1
2281,also the model i received was worth between and less than the one i paid for,0
2282,what i like it does last the hours,0
2283,there are also fewer options every app requires internet connectivity to work fullyfor some reason google decided it would be a great idea to limit the functionality of its apps if the computer isnt connected to the internet,1
2284,beyond that the customer service for this product has left me wishing their was a half star option but its getting one start for the few months that it worked,0
2285,ive been really missing having an android tablet since my nexus died a couple of years ago,0
2286,it would also be nice to be able to create and manage screen apps easier,1
2287,i have owned several laptops never an asus but this will be the last time i purchase this brand based on the quality i am experiencing,0
2288,it is actually pounds or less not lbs as in the description,0
2289,pro pretty fast no problems at all with games or any other programs i use looks pretty nice and feels cool with the aluminium body design it starts really fast with the asus instant on kick ass sound thin and portable design even with the screencons no backlight keyboard would be perfect if it would have it there is a little disperfection with the mousepad its like bulk in the left side that makes it feel its not well assembly and the top right side of the spacebar feel hard to press battery life is bad to averager so you have to carry your charger mostlyso far i love it and its a great machine for that price i think,1
2290,this is my second asus laptop and if they keep it up like this theyll have all my future computer money,0
2291,i purchased on oct less then years later the product has shut down blank screen thru no fault or error or mishandling on my part any suggestions are greatly appreciated,0
2292,i thought it would be easier to use but the trouble im having with it is you cant just download anything like with a any other laptop you have to find an app compatible with the chrome download that then whatever it is like i try to downlaod tango it would not let me with out finding an app in the chrome store i could go thjru plus skype is not even compactible with chrome so i am trying otherways to contact my family in europe,1
2293,i up and reading e mail in my account in less than minutes,0
2294,here are the list of problems i have within less than hours receiving,0
2295,on a highly mature and competitive product like windows laptops there is no excuse for problems at this level,0
2296,it was sent to acer support center three times they would after send it back and the same problems would start all over again till this day,0
2297,unusable battery life is substantially less than my last acer netbook,0
2298,what i dont like is that the port is not colored blue which is industry standard the mm port supports both headset and microphone which means you can plug in an earbud or basic handsfree for use with skype and etc,0
2299,both computers batteries died in less than months,0
2300,we started to use the laptop less and less until our home computer died,0

2310,emailing browsing typing and do presentations seems to last a bit over hours,0
2311,while you cant install programs on it like regular laptop you can still squeeze a lot of juice out of it for example i have linux installed on my chromebook and with that i can use it as a regular pc,0
2312,bottom line if they dont fix this issue expect your chromebook to last less than a year,0
2313,contacted asus customer service and they indicated i can either contact the local asus service center or send it to their california service center,0
2314,last dell product i purhase,0

2316,within a month or so it crapped out with a message about the operating system being missing or damaged,0
2317,files works fine but it would be nice if there were other file managers such as androids es file explorer or xplorer available for the chromebook,1
2318,i like the darker lid in the exynos chip based model i wished they went the same direction in the intel based model as well,1
2319,but once you enter your credentials that is when you notice that ssd drive is missing systems takes some time to load up all your settings and background apps,0
2320,in less than a year of ownership the screen has begun to flicker when changing the position of the screen,0
2321,im not a computer geek but as a regular user using it for note taking surfing the internet listening to music etc,0
2323,click on the plus next to processor power management followed by expanding maximum processor state by clicking on the respective plus next to that,0
2324,if i applied slight pressure from the back of the screen the clouding would disappear,0
2325,bought it as a christmas gift for my daughter last year and never had a problems,0
2326,for a period of about weeks the laptop was used for less than an hour,0
2327,with the cost of memory being what it is today this machine should come with no less than gigs of solid state memory,0
2328,when i purchased it i was concerned that i would find the relatively stripped functionality to be a problem but its been a great laptop that i look forward to using for a long time,1
2329,after month of regular use the trackpad cracked with absolutely no external damage was done to the computer,0

2337,i have exclusively owned apple computers for the last ten years and my last experience owning a windows based laptop was horrid,0
2338,within the last weeks the product had all together stopped connecting to the internet no matter where i was,0
2339,remember that you can not add regular software programs to this thats a trade off allowing it to be so compact,0
2340,the last hp laptop i bought the battery was in a separate bubble rap with the power chord but this one came already in the laptop,0
2341,ive had it for two months now so i cant speak to its overall longevity but i know that the battery life when im just browsing the internet and working on word documents is actually hours,0
2342,i downloaded which did take several hours but worth it,0
2343,i bought this chromebook for my daughters bday last year,0

2351,accessing the wifi menu with two external monitors plugged in often causes all displays to blank,0
2352,battery last about as advertised,0
2353,it feels like its going to last and not lose its stiffness which is a big deal so your screen doesnt just flop over,0
2354,comparatively my last charger was the size of a buick,0
2355,next time we will go with an apple product since that company actually provides customer service,0
2356,pcs would usually last me about years so im hoping that this chromebook lasts longer than that,0
2357,im a previous owner of the model razer blade so i already had some idea of what to expect from this computer prior to purchase,0
2358,for this reason i am posting my previously published review on this webpage for those customers who may be initially directed to this specific samsung webpage,0
2359,the last thing is the battery life,0
2360,im trying run my buiness from this computer and i can not do the simpliest of things like upload pic my recommedations just spend a few extra bucks and get what ya need the computer is a waste,0
2361,i think it would be wonderful for every kid in school to have one and cut back on some of the weight they carry in their backpacks every day,1
2363,i spent several hours with dell tech support and had no success,0
2364,now about days later the screen is doing the same thing,0
2365,my boyfriend bought this laptop and one day we were watching movies and go to bed the next day we wake up and the screen looks like it has been split in half,0

2368,this mpb is the one as me olde eyes cant appreciate retina and this is the last upgradable mbp battery and ram not glued in firewire dvd drive yep,0
2369,so i installed the internal sata adapter and an existing gb ssd paid for and previously used in the acer for two years as others describe and then installed linux mint attempting a dual boot configuration,0
2370,and an external keyboard and mouse all connected through ananker usb dual display universal docking station,0
2371,that means any programmer who works on this cloud and wants to install a back door to get into your data can do so,0
2372,i would recommend the xca hcl or the i version as they come with bluetooth the fact that this model is missing bluetooth disappoints me,0
2373,it would be nice if it had a homeend keyyoull want to remember these hotkeys ctrl alt up arrow home also use this to scroll to the very top of the page quickly or you can also press searchfind key the magnifying glass key the key right above the left shift key left arrowctrl alt down arrow end also to scroll to the very bottom quickly or search key righ arrowalt arrow up to scroll upalt arrow down or spacebar to scroll downalt backspace deletectrl w to close windowstabsctrl tab to switch tabs actually i find a better way recently where you can use three fingers and swipe the mousepad left or right to actually select between different window tabs,1

2383,i have been using macbook pro with retina display for last two years,0
2384,i bought mine on amazon in for around mine is the gb sshd its motherboard died just outside the warranty period,0
2385,several forums and users reviews referenced the same issue some tried replacing the wireless card and one guy sent his back to dell to replace parts and it still came back with the same issue,0
2386,it may be a download once they get their support site up but for now it is missing in action,0
2387,also the computer randomly loses connection from the internet all together and i have to put it into airplane mode then back out of airplane mode,0
2388,boot times are quicker and lakes less time to install programs,0
2389,last step is installing windows and do a manual search for the drivers since asus does not support any os besides windows on this model,0
2390,last night when i opened the lid the screen did not respond,0
2391,this is a criticism of google not chromebook although it would be nice if chromebook would provide a way to tell google to butt out,1
2392,it would be great if i can just plug the chromebook to my printer and directly print,1
2393,i was looking for a computer that can be used daily for surfing the web and occasional ms office use,0
2394,there are physical volume buttons next to the power button,0

2397,the screen occasionally flashes white,0
2398,dont buy this computer unless you plan to get repairs in less than three months after purchase,0
2399,it is marketed to students but i think many users would like this,1
2400,the unit probably has less than hours of use on it to this point,0
2401,i could care less about the battery life its not what a gaming laptop should worry about but its an issue for some,0
2402,it would be nice if the office key was not only a year though,1
2403,i swear im not making this up as i was typing that last sentence the computer zoomed out to because my palm hit the touchpad as i was typing,0
2404,i have had coreldraw adobe indesign microsoft edge excel evernote and notes all running at the same time jumping back and forth between programs,0
2405,i call them again half an hour later and support suggests i update the driver as well as the chipset to hopefully solve the cd drive problem,0
2406,it worked that day but after i shut the computer down and restarted it the next day the problem was back,0
2407,if you dont choose the cloud for your storage place you have to save your files onto a usb flash or external drive or hope you dont fill up the gb of storage left on the device after the operating system was installed,0
2408,need to buy dongle to have standard usb expansion and hdmi port to connect to external monitor,0
2409,im an old guy and not computer savvy i wish there was a instruction book for us dummies,1
2410,this laptop is revved up on the inside for gaming power but the outside looks doesnt do it justice,0
2411,one last thing the ports are in the back,0
2412,dont get less than gb ram or less than gb storage,0
2413,besides the same thing would happen in a comparable gb model but less noticeable its just the way the os is setup,0
2414,you would think that the same standard would be upheld or slightly surpassed after years but that did not happen with this asus laptop,0
2415,i bought two of these chromebooks for the express purpose of having back to basics computers for social media and e mail that i could toss into a bag or onto the couch without that oh no factor you get if you were to do that to a mac or ultrabook,0
2416,i had heard rumors that chromebooks solved these problems sort of like that old lady at hardees back home has been solving my biscuits and gravy fix for the last couple decades,0
2417,on the software side all of the asus drivers were missing as it seemed that the computer had been wiped and windows reinstalled,0
2418,update laptop has died a bit less than a year later and speakers never worked all the time,0
2419,i have not done any benchmarking but with my external drives unplugged causes my computer to post longer because they need to spool up my computer boots up in less than seconds from time i hit the power button to all my applications load in windows,0
2420,this one is a lot faster then my last computer,0
2421,will not accept boot manager software or inputs from outside source,0

2425,the battery lasts way less than hours,0
2426,the emmc card is not soldered into the motherboard but unconventionally placed inside a ssd caddy with a converter pcb to accept a regular sata cable,0
2427,after less than a year the wifi wont work anymore,0
2428,i have run into a technical issue and need to send the computer back for repair still under warranty,0
2429,i run a nd k monitor so that quadro chip is running k x without any noticable drag on the system,0
2430,i put every settings on performance over quality the battery stays up haf hrs sumtyms less,0
2431,less than years isnt acceptable,0
2432,one last thing this computer comes with windows out of the box,0
2433,i wished this screen has resolution of x instead of x,1
2434,i bought it years back and the battery stopped charging few months back,0
2435,he purchased it a few months ago but you know how it is when youve used the same software for several years in this case or,0
2436,it would be actually great if hp provides an option with gb ssd,1
2437,the battery didnt last months,0
2438,broke in less then a year,0
2439,battery charges from and fills up in minutes or less,0
2440,also the wifi kicks me off regularly while my partner is sitting next to me on her laptop with no problems,0
2441,i do wish it gave us regular office instead of the year subscription,0
2442,it fits in my bag and is less cumbersome for the airport crew to handle ive had them drop one by the way,0
2443,i wish that the battery lasted longer yet as with most of my complaints given the price it is completely understandable,1
2444,after researching this issue online i see several people have the same issue with no resolution,0
2445,battery last hours,0
2446,i built my previous system and several others,0
2447,it stops so that the screen can be propped up but it makes it less versatile,0
2448,hardwareprocessor the th generation haswell i u processor is snappy yet less power hungry than a third generation one,0
2449,browsing the internet i would see a white flickering line in the middle of the screen when scrolling down,0
2450,i then wrote to the third party company and asked the same question,0
2451,it feels a bit heavy to me in terms of true portability especially for having plastic parts i wish it felt more sturdy,1
2452,ive had mine less than a week and had to powerwash twice,0
2453,battery power it supposed to last hours depends on the settings,0
2454,not worth the price had a lot of problems with it and sent back,0
2455,this specific model does not have the levels of red vents as pictured there is no blu ray,0
2456,i did pick this up at target since it is on sale this week for plus cartwheel gives you an extra plus red card another,0
2457,yes ddr ram memory does work this system comes with ddrl sodimm and for the life of me i could not find a definitive answer if regular ddr sodimm ram would work,0
2458,if you choose to upgrade the computers ram you must get one that is ddrl not ddr because the l stands for lowpower so if you were to get the regular ram it would not work,0
2459,i have been using this laptop since last year without any issue,0
2460,ran several hours worth of updates out of the box,0
2461,im not sure if thats the case for everyone or just me you get used to it after a while it was in my backpack when the bus made an emergency break and screen got broken had to replace it myself not really a con but a bad luck and it cost to fix i wish it used usb type c port for charging not really sure about possibility of that tho no separate fan for gpu its not an absolute need but it would be a great addition there is an optical drive that extra space and weight would be great if used for something useful its not designed to be comfortable when using it with mouse you cant use one of the usb ports and the charging port is on the right side as well now the better part pros not heavy not ultraportable either tho great battery lifeprice is greatgreat everyday performancecan play every game i can throw at it in fhd with reduced graphics options except doom which needs very high framerates to be playable and mafia iii which has terrible optimization,1
2462,customer service with acer is less than desirable,0
2463,overall the lenovo ideapad really is a star laptop once i got over the initial shock that i was expecting an i processor as the former product listing had initially stated,0
2464,battery life was initially about an hour less but with a few batches of updates now its about the same as with,0
2465,every product line is bound to have a few defective units here and there get used to it and just send it back for another,0
2466,there is a hazy yellow tint to the screen no matter the calibrations adjustments or any action taken,0
2467,i cant speak for later models technical aspects pricepoint etc,0
2468,hp and their support group couldnt care less,0
2469,i purchased the extra ramkingston technology gb mhz ddrl pc v non ecc cl sodimm intel laptop memory kvrlsand a ssd to boost the performancesamsung evo gb inch sata iii internal ssd mz ebam,0
2470,nothing like to chromebook i received last year,0
2471,a second reset gave me a blue screen of death so i shipped it back to amazon,0
2472,this unit appears to have the same coating on the screen that makes touch a drag,0
2473,again maybe a driver thing but thats not an excuse,0
2475,they havent changed since last year either,0
2476,btw it ran for hours and hours last night i checked it i still had over minutes,0
2477,all i know is i cant update my internal wifi drivers because it crashes the system and my usb wifi dongle cant be updated either for the same reason,0
2478,but this computer will last years i would assume if you take care of it,0
2479,might have to look in the instructions or online sites that require java wont work but luckily java is slowly going away i realize youre supposed to store everything in the cloud but it would be nice if they replace the gb ssd with a gb ssd and bumped the price up by only two usb ports and they are instead of,1
2480,months later when i went to close the laptop and instead of the hinge bending all pressure was put onto the screen and it bent the screen causing the moniter to split in half,0
2481,starting it up takes less than secs to boot into system,0
2482,this will be an issue when the battery needs to be replaced in the future which if you keep the computer for several years is probably going to happen,0
2483,the computer also regularly crawls to a stop and is unusable,0
2484,ive contacted samsung and got a service request in for a laptop that ive had in my possession for less than hours,0
2485,second when i asked the technical support representative to recommend an adapter that would work he claimed that the adapter that was used to test the tb on dual k monitors was an apple usb c digital av multiport adapter,0
2486,for a laptop of k usd i cant believe ive had these issues with less than a month of usage,0
2487,i like the fingers drag on mac but i cant find the driver on sb to do the same,0
2488,if you do happen to update your wlan driver later and the speed dies and you know exactly what you did it can be reversed by rolling back the driver in device manager,0
2489,really gets me mad because i just wasted bucks on an gb memory card hopefully this will improve some of the slowness,1
2491,the battery can last upwards of eight hours with those operating conditions,0
2492,this chromebook is at the one year mark and after semi regular use the battery will no longer charge,0
2493,in the future it would be nice if lenovo used a driver that allows for this kind of customization from within the windows settings like the surface line,1
2494,if i put in the equivalent offers from prostar it would be upwards and perhaps low s or high s if i knew to not have the inferior parts not installed,1
2495,this model has had no issues like the last one,0
2496,i left off the last star because of price,0
2497,we were on the phone with tech support from acer for a few hours after two days we had to ship it back to acer,0
2498,the only thing i really hate about it is it does not have an ethernet cord plug outlet it only runs on wifi and sometimes you go places such as school sites that have wifi passwords and it would be nice to just be able to plug the computer in or else you dont have access,1
2499,you can still use it with windows but linux is where this computer shines core intel ssd gb of memory for less than and not a chromebook,0
2500,a half hour later i was still getting those messages,0
2501,but i do not think less power consumption gains anything noticeable on laptop,0
2502,it would be great for your granny or a small child maybe if they never need to do anything other than use email browse the internet and goof off on youtube,1
2503,my last one was back in the time of vista when acer was doing a clam shell type design,0
2505,if it were not for the missing parts i would give this laptop five stars,0
2506,he can get on social media and do schoolwork on it drive just doesnt capitalize for him so i give it stars,0
2507,this chromebook is lightweight and has a battery that seems to last forever,0
2508,in less than a year the charging port broke on this product,0
2509,this pc replaces an hpcompaq laptop that ive used every day for the last years,0
2510,this means that i take my laptop to the public library where i download the return label information to the library system and then use the library printer to print out the return label,0
2511,two reasons why it has one less star than the sd slot on the side does not insert all the way in,0
2512,didnt even last years,0
2513,not send you to a regular computer to add a cloud printer,0
2514,after losing my grip on my computer a few weeks ago it slid less than a foot from my hand to the floor being on the edge of my bed and landed on the power cord still plugged into the computer,0
2515,i purchased this laptop less than a year ago and its already failing as a computer,0
2516,i bought my lenovo yoga last august and it has been returned to the manufacturer twice for an internal power supply problem,0
2517,i used a custom version of windows to run faster and use less drive space,0
2518,it does last few hours,0
2519,a charge will last about hours unless youre gaming and the laptop charges in about an hour,0
2520,also space is an issue but an external or extra internal drive fixes that,0
2521,if you try to play video games or use even medium brightness your battery will literally last hours,0
2522,also i had laptops in last years from dell inspiron and lattitude and batteries on both laptops died after about year,0
2523,for instance while ive been typing this review it froze up but i kept typing and about seconds later it caught up with what i had typed several times now in less than minutes,0
2524,this notebook was refurbished and not even the same computer internally,0
2525,even though there is a slight noise in my computers radiator i would like also to give it stars,1
2526,turn the laptop around hit the outside screen switch and i have a tablet at the angle i want and can watch movies or still just use the tablet as it was meant to be used,0
2527,i owned a previous dell from back when windows xp was a powerhouse,0
2528,the computer stopped working less than a year,0
2529,nothing missing from this computer,0
2530,we got this as a second laptop for the household when two people want to get on the computer at the same time,0
2531,a few hours after the rep had left i had reason to put the pc in the tent mode to watch a movie and discovered the screen image no longer would rotate degrees when the unit was flipped,0
2532,microsoft office is a big absence from the chromebook ecosystem,0
2533,also the battery life can easily last around hours,0
2534,the battery life is a big pro because it last hours,0
2535,just something to keep in mind you can get an jump drive for less than twenty bucks that will double your storage space all while taking up just an inch or two of space in your laptop bag,0
2536,the screen went out less than days of owning it,0
2537,i had bought this laptop from the ibuypower website around the summer to fall of last year,0
2538,when i researched this item no one said chromebooks had issues linking to wifi on public servers,0
2539,it would be nice if it was backlit but hopefully that will come in future iterations of the toshiba chromebook,1
2540,its the last computer i buy from dell after years of buying their computers and monitors,0
2541,and now that the price is less than gb the upgrade is a no brainer,0
2542,we have restored the computer multiple times and changed a few things here and there but lenovo has done something to their computers that you can not make your changes permanent,0
2543,less than two months since buying the screen went out,0
2544,the battery last a lot longer,0
2545,my last outing without the safety of house electricity time out at hours hum lost an hour,0
2546,after buying asus computers from amazon that stopped working less than months after purchasing seems to be a recurrent problem on their reviews,0
2547,and it just went out after less than a year wont power on,0
2548,a conversion adapter micro usb to usb is included so usb items can still be used as with a regular notebook,0
2549,however i will have to post battery life with the tb wd blue since it is a less power hungry drive,0
2550,overall i spend extra dollar on this computer where i should not have,0
2551,it is marketed to students but i think many users would like this computer,1
2552,one and a half years after buying it from one day to the next it just never turned on again,0
2553,then last night my wife was watching a video on it and the screen just displayed digital lines everywhere see attachment,0
2554,i dont print a lot so not a big negative and there are workarounds but it would be nice to just be able to hook up any printer,1
2555,faster speed and the the battery last longer,0
2556,after it got stolen a few years later i went back to being a pc user with an hp,0
2557,as im outside the usa warranty is not valid read terms of warranty st,0
2558,it had no battery life literally out of the box less than hours,0
2559,i bougth last one few days ago july and dont powerup even if i try to make escrefreshpower,0
2560,the spectre and z book have k screens the samsung just a regular hd screen,0
2561,the overall system configuration is worth the price,0
2562,chromebook screen broke less than year,0
2563,in less than three months ive had to reinstall the wireless drive five times,0
2564,my last computer was a compaq notebook running windows xp and thank the lord it is still running,0
2565,if you have never bought a laptop overseas this machine has an international warranty and seems to have been targeted to a variety of countries you might find the partitioning strange,0
2566,it would be really nice to have a product that works out of the box,1
2567,it would be nice to have my iphoto and itunes library on it but theres just no room,1
2568,when the battery shows less than it can backup data automatically so you wont lose it,0
2569,dropoff at fedex fedex picks up and begins shipment to dell followup w dell support and am told this is on standard instead of express as previously notified,0
2570,after about an hour of troubleshooting my boyfriend figured out that the network adapter driver was not installed during setup and was missing,0
2571,this is overall a very solid pc for the price i paid under k,0
2572,ive had less than a year and ive already reinstalled windows twice,0
2573,if this machine is gon na last me for two years i will be in heaven,0
2574,our kids break computers so when the they killed off our last laptop we bought one of these for them to do homework,0
2576,the battery should last all day hours on a charge,0
2577,less than months in to using it i can no longer double or triple click items reliably,0
2578,a guy named diego got back to me with the corrected expiry dates within a few hours,0
2579,i had been looking for something like this since last year and could not find enything excep apple and microsoft computer way over priced,0
2580,well after that the flickering stopped until few hours later when the the flickering started all over again,0
2581,i bought this computer hoping that it would last me for a while its not even a year as yet i wasnt using it for two weeks,0
2582,if you looking for a laptop with a touch screen for doing online activities email web searches word processing social media etc,0
2583,overall this laptop is what you would expect to perform when you have reviewed its specifications and is definitely worth its price,0
2584,they then called back and said that this was not covered under warranty because it was caused by physical damage,0
2585,september seems like it would be great if it didnt come with a broken screeni was really excited for my new asus chromebook,1
2587,never buy a computer with less than gb of ram unless you dont plan to use an internet browser,0
2588,i removed the regular inch drive and use it for backup and external storage,0
2589,that means hopefully there wont be a keyboard wearing indentation in the screen like there was from my last chromebook,0
2590,i installed lightroom last night,0
2591,i went for this machine to get away from the weight of my regular laptop computer but i cant say i feel it is money well spent,0
2592,the backlit keyboard the p display and the overall solid if plastic build make this feel like a machine,0
2593,the touch pad brings me back to the home windows screen occasionally when i am working and i still dont understand what move would prompt that response,0
2594,but what matters is that the computer starts in less than seconds or perhaps less,0
2595,lastly is the size,0
2596,i ended up getting office and this laptop for less than dollars tax included,0
2597,also the web browser that comes with it is not internet explorer like your regular windows computer,0
2598,well not quite it loaded to a white screen that said chrome os is missing or damaged and said to visit a specific url to start the recovery process,0
2599,the second item began showing signs of malfunctioning within an hour operations freezing keyboard not responding strange flickering of a webpage etc,0
2600,i upgraded the ram to gb and got a generic usb dvdcd rw and shes in business for less than bucks,0
2601,several users have reported the flicker not just happen with the laptop screen but with external monitors through hdmi output port that confirms the hardware issues on the motherboard circuit,0
2602,while there are several limits on what you can do with the chromebook without wifi there are still offline apps that can be used like your google drive google docs and a few others,0
2603,the computer also acts strangely with the charger plugged in doing things like minimizing the window to a x inch mini in the middle of the screen with no warning or explanation,0
2605,hey im in love with hp products i have an hp laptop now i have a very large following on fb instagram youtube i would love to do a review on this product,1
2606,if there is something less than one star i will give it to asus because of the missed up support line,0
2607,returned the unit to amazon after having it in the house less than hours,0
2608,my last laptop had maybe hours and took seconds to compile anything while this one is snappier,0
2609,has the big screen plenty of cpu power for browsing the net but not for gamers,0
2610,i wish all computers were built like this were the bottom slides off for easy access to internal parts no screws,1
2611,it locked after the days warranty therefore when i sent it back the money returned was less than what i paid for,0
2612,when my previous sony laptop would no longer charge its battery after three years i ordered a lenovo laptop which seemed to have what i wanted but i had to send it back and ordered this acer aspire,0
2613,i cant see any difference than a regular size keyboard,0
2614,as a last ditch effort i went back to hp support website where you can type the model and hp will find your computer,0
2615,in years i hope acer has an equivalent device as ill definitively buy from them if thats the case,1
2616,next is holding down the power button for seconds to power off then pressing for another seconds to turn back on,0
2617,i think some sort of biometric device is a necessity nowadays lastly i would think that a laptop geared towards power users or business folks would come with windows pro instead of the home edition,0
2618,speed portable realiable everything u need if u wan na stay socailly connected business oriented and just overall satisfaction,0
2619,ive ordered quite a few of these for my employees over the last years and they are workhorses,0
2620,the overall size of this is about the same as a sheet letter size spiral notebook but just a touch thicker,0
2621,even if they do not continue with the cloud storage you can get an external drive for less than,0
2622,i even paid for expedited international shipping thinking the product would actually work,0
2623,for example i cant search back into last years events to find out the last time i went to the dentist,0
2624,i was always worried about it coming up missing after going through airport security the thieves in the tsa,0
2625,i have had it for maybe less than a year,0
2626,multiple issues include the display in less than a year of ownership,0
2627,i couldnt even use ms word which you have to buy of course god forbid they actually make something like that standard on all computers nowadays,0
2628,i cant wait till they figure out how to make batteries last longer,0
2629,it would be great if they could add the magnifying feature from android where you click on something and if it isnt sure what you meant it will enlarge the area so you can more easily tap what you want,1
2630,the th gen wasnt even around last year so this is a big deal,0
2631,so if you want to spend on a computer that may last a year then go for it,0
2632,i tried again hours later same thing,0
2633,still missing netflix and audio blue tooth support which could trigger my return of the unit if not forthcoming,0
2634,this is the last straw do not buy this product,0
2635,zero bloatware here is a trend that i hope many other manufacturers follow,1
2636,a few months ago it started crashing and since i got a gift card used it towards a tcb last month,0
2637,lasts all day and charges in less than two hours,0
2638,i bought this laptop last year,0
2639,have been using this computer exclusively for almost the last six months,0
2640,so then i pressed on the power button for a few seconds until it shut down and i powered it back up and the screen came back to life,0
2641,two drives of less than that,0
2642,i attempted on several networks with the same results to rule out wireless modems,0
2643,this is a big deal for me so i reinstalled the laptop with a copy of windows re partitioned the hdd during the process minus the recovery partition and then upgraded back to windows,0
2644,left it on for several hours to ensure it wouldnt shut itself down again,0
2645,it last for hours on end if your just doing regular things on it like watching youtube or typing a paper,0
2646,probably will be one of the last to upgrade to windows even though hp sent me a disk for it,0
2647,we dont even use ours anymore and weve had them less than a year,0
2648,the two extensions involved add to feedly and tweet this page each had less than users but these users started to experience unwanted ads and complain about this upon support forums according to the wall street journal,0
2649,i am doing some programming a bit video editing some regular use like surfing on it and you know what,0
2650,i was going to throw it in the garbage wasnt worth the price of shipping it back,0
2651,i was looking for a model that was so smalllight that i wouldnt have to think twice about whether i wanted to drag it along in my bag,0
2652,perhaps it is less glossy than some but i can still use it as a mirror when the screen is off,0
2653,i am outside my window to return to amazon so i have been trying to deal with asus warranty department,0
2654,overall though its a solid computer for the price point,0
2655,i also have not seen overheating on this yet unlike the gs that i tried last year,0
2656,with the series chromebook there are no moving parts meaning there is less parts that can break generate heat or consume electricity,0
2657,lastly i did not buy the extended warranty bought it times before on the hps and used it once,0
2658,i replaced the driver from the website several ties and it still has the same issue,0
2659,im quickly starting the process to get asus to cover the repairs before my warranty is up in a month just so i can have something to get me through the last few months of college,0
2660,after owning the laptop for less than hours and spending over dollars i am having conversations with customer service,0
2661,lastly i wish it would be easier to import my music from my itunes library,0
2662,it is extra lightweight comes on immediately and battery life last all day about hours,0
2663,we have had this less than year and it no longer works,0
2664,the design of the notebook allows the keyboard section to tilt at an angle for ease of typing i believe this design makes it less stressful on my wrists and hands as i type,0
2665,before we start do keep in mind that this is the second dell chromebook dell released one last year and now released this one with the same name,0
2666,lastly any moistness whatsoever on the touchpad or the touchscreen will make the computer go haywire,0
2667,at this point bluetooth wireless speakers and trackpad dont work less than a year after purchase,0
2668,it did work well to connect to my dslr via usb to back images up to my external drive though a slight con regarding this mentioned later,0
2669,i started using chromebooks a year and a half ago for online school and have never looked back,0
2670,after several minutes the technician told me that my graphics card was not fitted properly in and that this was actually a hardware issue and i would need to send back the laptop,0
2671,less than three months after purchase number keys stopped working so we cant even sign in,0
2672,if youre like me and of the time you spend on a computer is spent on social media and internet browsing then a chromebook cant be beat,0
2673,i had everything in pieces so it was much easier to do this but taking everything apart would be much harder to put back together,0
2674,suspected less battery time but apple offered months warrenty wo asking and not to mention complinetry g making machine g at price of g hdd,0
2675,few minutes later found phone number online,0
2676,now i am stuck with this laptop as amazon support window closed days back,0
2677,i wish the screen quality was a little better but overall not too bad,1
2678,for the last ten years my experience has been with ms based servers and workstations,0
2679,now i have to deal with this issue outside of amazon as i just got back in the country on july st and the support ran out the next day,0
2680,just plugged in says chrome is missing or damaged please insert a recovery usb stick or sd card,0
2681,battery seems to last unplugged around hours,0
2682,it would be nice if dell explained the problem its cause and possible solutions,1
2683,based on the specs this thing is no less than dollars overpriced,0
2684,another thing it would be nice to be able to play dvds on this dell with f windows computer,1
2685,the new aspire is great much faster thanks to the improved hard drive and with gigabytes of ram hopefully it will hold up for another years,1
2686,i got this computer so i could do a few basic things social media do my taxes online watch netflix,0
2687,i have asus products and have not had a problem over the last years,0
2688,i was looking for a or less inch touchscreen just to take with me when im out and about,0
2689,the ca is a big upgrade in terms of speed and screen quality plus the battery last a bit longer too,0
2690,then months later same thing it froze up and they said it was something with the battery,0
2691,unlike actual mechanical drives these guys are digital and store information digitally,0
2692,tv and netflix without crashing or a lot of buffering which i cant say about my last computer that i had for years before replacing it with this,0
2693,it took me probably less than minutes to get accustomed to the size of the keyboard and where the keys are,0
2694,this is not a regular laptop that you can load up office products and use,0
2695,i dont use the second screen as much but it is useful if you like having a touch screen and are torn between a tablet and a laptop,0
2696,not a computer geek so cant give the technical feed back,0
2697,cons battery life is less than they claimed,0
2698,their forums at the time i called in had a page post of complaints about this component being missing and when i called in their tech support still didnt believe that mine was missing,0
2700,that means it has less battery life,0
2701,less memory than my phone has and battery lasted a year,0
2702,so if i was gaming the battery would last even less time,0
2703,the time is now pm the following day hours later and the computer is still updating,0
2704,normally as a last ditch effort i would disconnect the power cord and remove the battery,0
2705,nothing i did showed the laptop having any life left in it and after fiddling with it for a few days decided to use it for parts,0
2706,if you setup the way i stated less the nd video card you will have the fastest computer made that includes any tower motherboard type computers bar none,0
2707,pros battery life last all day,0
2708,set it up and encrypted in less than an hour,0
2709,subsequent users can be added and deleted but not the owner,0
2710,subsequently it was left by the service center even though the error code showed back up seconds after windows re installed the driver,0
2711,got dual booted with ubuntu linux to run regular programs,0
2712,lasts hours of web browsing and doesnt throw any heat probably less heat than what a tablet would throw and it can run counter strike global offensive without a glitch,0
2713,overall if you have the extra cash get the gb ram model,0
2714,hour battery life and charges in two hours or less,0
2715,it is about feet lastly the price,0
2716,please samsung i hope this product continues its strong start,1
2717,that being said who knows maybe a non removeable battery will be less prone to damage from spills,0
2718,the tech rep arrived a few day later swapped out the motherboard power port and exchanged the ac cable and adapter,0
2719,watching videos and browsing reddit and stuff like that it will last it hours,0
2720,properly maintained it might last years,0
2721,i would not purchase an acer again because it only lasted one year i hope i get longer out of this one,1
2722,edit after an initial rating of stars i am reducing it after a year and a half,0
2723,system stats milled aluminum case i u ghz processor gb ram operating system built in touchpad and bluetooth connectivity speakers comes with windows sd slot hd video slot usb slots pros very light weight responsive touchpad great sound nice screen resolution cons it would be nice to have been slightly larger so as to have dvd drive theres a lot of power in this little package,1
2724,it didnt last for two years,0
2725,battery does not last hours,0
2726,this one last for a couple of hours even at max load,0
2727,my last bit of review regards the video card,0
2728,battery malfunctioned after days just outside of return period,0
2729,however its not a regular computer so dont expect to install games photoshop be a power user or write any codeprogram because you cant do that on it,0
2730,the touchscreen is a mess and i dont even use the touchscreen havent from the beginning since the keyboard functionality would not work if i used the touchscreen for any extended period of time say ten minutes,0
2731,this laptop can barely run word let alone process a touch screen and multiple screens desktops,0
2732,next tablet i buy will be based on the quality of its battery to recharge properly over say yrs,0
2733,its powered by last years intel n celeron processor at ghz and has gigabytes of ram and gigabytes of on board storage,0
2734,its weight and size inch screen is a lot easier on your back than a or inch laptop with a solid metal case,0
2736,when you actually look at them side by side with a field of white on the screen the acer looks really blue,0
2737,google issues with the ideapad and all lenovo products i wish i had before i made this mistake,1
2738,i gave stars because ive had it for less than a month and the screen cracked while it was in a laptop sleeve in my backpack,0
2739,lower left corner of screen isnt glued properly so it doesnt sit flush with the case,0
2740,last week the second asus came home with a cracked screen,0
2741,the pascal architecture gives the performance jump to buy a good machine form many year it would be nice to have a stronger cpu processor but that means more cost to an allready expensive machine,1
2742,also i find that i regularly get hours of battery life taking notes browsing etc,0
2743,battery last forever for me,0
2744,a computer should last longer than a year,0
2745,blue screen of death multiple times per day,0

2747,after a few days of testing installing all of my programs and pushing the graphics card to the limits i have made several conclusions regarding this laptop,0
2748,also the charging port seems less flimsy,0
2749,to summarize i dont want a touchscreen when typing and doing emails and regular laptop functions,0
2750,my last advice stay away from this brand,0
2751,knowing what i know now i just bought my last acer product,0
2752,it would be nice if it connected to my home wi fi but i have to take it down to the public library to use it,1
2753,the laptop came with hardware and software issues and the replacement sent back also had the same issues,0
2754,and im hoping that in the future revised specs for computer peripherals will be timely disclosed to peripherals manufacturers and end users aka the public so we have fully functioning computers and peripherals at the time of purchase,0
2755,once a few programs are running and every time you click you have to wait several seconds before anything happens at all,0
2756,why pay for almost for a computer when it cant even last a year,0
2757,all that said for the price this is a good machine that will let you surf the web check your email run some programs and hopefully last a few years before something fizzles out,1
2758,boots up in under seconds and all programs including ms word are running within seconds or less,0
2759,reasons not working not properly working camera the camera is not recognized by any pre installed software skype camera standard windows application tridef smartcam preinstalled camera utility it is not found by system at all no camera in device manager,0
2760,i shut it down removed the bottom cover and disconnected the internal battery and power waited a few minutes reconnected everything and powered the system back up,0
2761,this one was a step back in almost every way that counts the previous one was touch screen this one was not,0
2762,updated review after using this for about months im lowering my rating from the initial stars to i wisht they had stars when i move the screen back and forth it blue screens or external monitors disconnect,0
2763,i wish the screen was touch capable as advertised just for my kids to be able to draw on,1
2764,outside screen worked for about a week,0
2765,my last computer was a hp envy,0
2766,i also tried a few games running locally including pacman dx luftrausers and towerfall ascension,0
2767,purchased and received this computer is being returned less than one month after purchase,0
2768,i bought this computer last week,0
2769,it would be to great to have the wifi embedded so i can get online anywhere and not be dependent on my home wifi or a cafe connection,1
2770,i spoke to the warranty company who said since it was less than days to follow amazons advise,0
2772,ive looked at the diagram several times i think they sent a minor incorrect cord or its just missing,0
2773,less connectivity options as just an hdmi connector usbs and an sd card reader,0
2774,i called acer support and the guy i spoke with seemed to know less about computers than i do,0
2775,encountered some internal issue gave me a blue screen and never turned on again,0
2776,may be selling defective products with less price,0
2778,last year about this time i picked up an acer chromebook for,0
2779,the casing is lightweight and while typing the screen actually jiggles back and forth a bit,0
2780,the last time i had to contact dell support and actually ended up re installing windows,0
2781,i got the same thing here minus gb of ram and the disconnect ability of the undocking mode for almost k less,0
2782,maybe not a common need but annoying for how basic a task this is screen size i would like about one more inch,1
2783,i have had it less than a year and this morning it fried on me,0
2784,after plugging it up and going through a few prelims the screen went blank and would not return,0
2785,this is probably the last model surviving,0
2786,then less than an hour to install all the microsoft updates,0
2787,the wireless card worked excellently it actually made me jump back a bit when it just worked without hesitation with ac and bluetooth functionality included,0
2788,this is a wonderful laptop although it would be nice if accessories like a second power supply were easier to get,1
2789,quit working and in the trash less than a year from purchase,0
2790,i have never had a screen break on me and my computers usually last years not months,0
2791,less than three months and my screen is now at an angle since the hinge doesnt support it correctly,0
2792,the webcam did not work so i upgraded windows then i lost internet connectivity and i had to go back to a previous version of windows,0
2793,it would be so nice to use my computer without feeling like throwing it through the window,1
2794,bought this for my daughter for christmas last year and now it wont charge,0
2795,im not a very technical person to let you know how it performs but it does what i need it to which is surf store pics listen to music develop power points for work etc,0
2797,i can even take it outside on my deck under a gazebo and see the screen without any problems,0
2798,for the price of a chromebook it certainly is not a big risk to try and you can use it as a second computer,0
2800,after another hour on the phone with customer service they informed me that it had to be sent back to the us repair center,0
2801,their customer service is as poor as their quality and if you do get this computer i hope your luck was much better than ours,1
2802,i have the db server installed and i regularly have instances of vs running simultaneously,0
2803,you may need to restart the pc once without the hdd in the second slot once it is cloned then shut down and reinstall the hdd to the second bay,0
2804,i would guess because i havent tested that the battery would last to hours,0
2805,battery life is now about double what i had previously,0
2806,i had the machine under warranty so both were replaced battery rapidly held less and less charge at this point if i pull the ac plug the computer immediately turns off every time the computer wakes from sleep the trackpad disappears from the device manager,0
2807,while prices of both models are relatively the same around for i and for i versions as of march on amazon there are several differences,0
2808,i dont see how this will last once the years are up,0
2809,i wish the screen was better but what do you expect from a chromebook that costs less than,1
2810,we began having problems with the charging port on this computer less than a month after purchase,0
2811,asuss way of giving apples retina display the big middle finger,0
2813,saving today isnt worth having to replace it a year later,0
2814,it subsequently powers off after seconds,0
2815,the touch screen is less responsive than competitors,0
2816,i have had this tablet laptop for less than a month and the touch screen has stopped working twice,0
2817,the unit also features an unoccupied msata mini half height slot and a standard mm ssd leaving lots of options for disc upgrades,0
2818,you could run a third extra screen by plugging it into the hdmi or vga port on the laptop,0
2819,the laptop has some scratches on the outside but none that werent already in the description,0
2820,i just want to say that i had the same update applied in less than an hour,0
2821,it lasts for less than hours,0
2822,resolving that problem and obtaining printer drivers that worked required several hours of professional attention,0
2823,i had to spend several hours figuring out how to use windows but it was worth it because of the screen,0
2824,i got this last christmas and less than a year later it started to fall apart,0
2825,the operating system crashed after just over a month outside return window and the fix found online didnt work,0
2826,but when we tried to charge it for the second time we couldnt get the plug into the laptop it started smoking and realized the plastic blue coating had melted into the charging port,0
2827,seems to have a slightly shorter life than my acer c which literally went for days but probably because of the aforementioned dozens of tabs and netflix,0
2828,in years as an it professional i have never had a laptop last me for less that three years,0
2829,i was also worried about getting a chromebook because of the limited internal storage inability to download programs and relative uselessness when not connected to the internet,0
2830,touchpads have gotten much better and are almost universally glass compared to the crappy plastic ones of days past and screens have massively improved over the past two years hopefully crappy tn panel x screens will be a thing of the past soon they overstayed their welcome for far too long and pc manufacturers gypped consumers with them for too long but these windows issues are still here and sadly might always be,1
2831,you have to wonder about a company when several others report the same problem,0
2832,i closed the display and opened it back up and the system was frozen,0
2833,an internal slot style or relocation of the button would be advisable for future systems,0
2834,the laptop motherboard crashed in less than year or purchase,0
2835,i store a lot of documents on google drive and use google sheets so for less than i thought it was worth a try entering into the chromebook world,0
2836,i had to send it to technical service and they told me that the problem was on the net card drivers both wireless and land ethernet connections,0
2837,it is the same operating system overall,0
2838,while playing games the battery will last about hours before i need to charge,0
2839,also the horizontal and vertical viewing angles are poor and i wish all laptop manufacturers will use at least use p if not uhd panels,1
2840,do not buy this laptopnot even a year and the lcd was brokentried to get it repaired and they said it was not under warrantyit did not last six months,0
2841,havent seen battery life last me the amount of hours mentioned,0
2842,st one didnt recognize any usb the second one wouldnt recognize external ssd,0
2843,when you realize of your time on a laptop is for reading video watching music listening research and schoolwork this chromebook gets the same use as a shiny macbook at less than the price,0
2844,same as the damn left side power plug,0
2845,he will probably have to put in a tb storage drive later on as well and maybe some extra ram,0
2846,after or times of the previous cycles would get kicked back to the login screen again and the process would start again,0
2847,this item had pre entered social media dating sites,0
2848,i would have given stars if battery could last for hrs in stead of hrs,0
2849,bought an acer laptop last year,0
2850,i have bought surface pro at the end of last year,0
2851,i just put up with it because i cant stand having to explain my problem for a third time to someone from basic support in india the biggest issue i have with the machine is the battery life,0
2852,i bought an hdmi cable that allows connection to standard hdmi ports for use with an external monitor or tv,0
2853,but in the future when battery life is reduced it will not be a few second replacement,0
2854,the housing mimics the unibody frame of the macbook air although it is made of a less durable plastic,0
2855,as for battery power this laptop is not going to last you six to eight hours,0
2856,ive used mac computers for the last few years but this does everything i need for a fraction of the cost,0
2857,way less if you do something graphics intensive,0
2858,lastly i like the fact that the power cord goes into the back of the unit,0
2859,i use the blank screen saver settings now to blank out the screen after a few minutes of no use,0
2860,asus zenbook uxua ah inch lcd displayed ultra slim laptop core i processor gb ddr gb ssd windows with harman kardon audio backlit keyboard fingerprint readeri bought this laptop last of week of july this year from usa and i returned to bangladesh after few days,0
2861,result is the laptop runs cooler and has less battery drain,0
2862,the screen quality is way less than a macbook,0
2863,i downloaded this driver this morning and it actually did correct the yellow colors on the screen,0
2864,wi fiso in november when i received this laptop i kept getting a display driver has stopped working and has recovered message after the computer would blink and freeze for a second or two and i have tried updating the driver but still have the same issue,0
2865,but guess who switched to the macbook last year and now loves it,0
2866,i havent used windows for years but hopefully ill get used to it,1
2867,i purchased on a daily deal and wish now that i bought as this was a bday gift for my son and i love using it more then my daughters kindle fire hdx inch although the picture quality is way better and my samsung galaxy s there is an app to get play store apps working on this which i will investigate although i would hope someday this would be native to the chrome os which i have read rumors about on some tech sites,1
2868,two of these things can be done in less than mins once you got all the part together,0
2869,it would be nice if acer went back to a battery that is removable externally,1
2870,even though it has just gb ram i havent had even a slightest hiccup with multiple tabsapps running with music streaming at the same time,0
2871,never have to worry about viruses like the regular computer,0
2872,buy a couple of them and perhaps enjoy win for a few more years and hopefully never have to use win,1
2873,the trade off here against the i giving up extra processing power for a thinner lighter and fan less design is seriously worth it,0
2874,i thought it was last years model,0
2875,also and this seems to have fixed itself there was a period where id leave it on and come back to an unresponsive pc with a blank screen that wouldnt wake up,0
2876,i will never suggest the lenova brand and the lenova brand couldnt care less,0
2877,after less than months the screen is back and the computer does not work,0
2878,i always start my computer reviews by noting that ive spent the last years in tech support as a systems administrator,0
2879,when i saw a deal for the macbook i wanted it it was going to be the same price as the odyssey and i thought itd be useful,0
2880,i purchased my daugher a chromebook last year and that thing was nothing but a toy,0
2881,for some reason occasionally the keyboard will double type letters for no reason whatsoever,0
2882,it is the th laptop i have owned since and the second solid state computer,0
2884,she can now edit a video show it to guests render and burn the discs and hand a hd professional quality dvd in less than two hours,0
2885,starting typing and few seconds later the word i typed would end up where the cursor was last placed,0
2886,when it is fully charged i can rely for the battery life to last me through the day until i get home,0
2888,im a regular chromebook user and this is my th one,0
2890,i tried everything i could think of to do pressing the power button regularly holding it down for several seconds pressing it multiple times etc but the backlit keyboard was no longer lighting up and the computer would no longer turn on or boot,0
2891,lastly and this is a big issue the custom nvidia graphics card used in the surface book doesnt work with photoshop,0
2892,i left the screws in the back plate at the center on the batterytouchpad side slightly loose,0
2893,my user experience has been responsive stutter less and reliable,0
2894,plus the computer regularly shuts off for no reason in the middle of doing things,0
2895,comes with internal m style ssd plus it has an extra internal bay so you can add a second ssd or sata drive,0
2896,dll was missing and that the program should be re installed,0
2897,last thing beats audio is a name,0
2898,last time i looked the rd party apps were all sketchy,0
2899,i thought it would be nicer to have a bigger screen than my phone,1
2900,and in less than a month it automatically updates to windows and i have plenty of room on the drive to do so,0
2901,this does not have a wired internet plug and you would think that it would advertise this in big print i do not care to have wifi i do not know anything about it and i would assume all computers have a regular internet plug,0
2902,everything literature and manufacturer date points to this being last years model,0
2903,if buying this computer it would have to be for basic use and i wouldnt expect to add many programs or other items to it and have any performancespeed left,1
2904,stay away this laptop does not work used for about one day and then lost wifi connection a never got it back blue screen everytime i tried to connect,0
2905,i bought one and it didnt last one year,0
2906,i wont knock off any points for being bulkier and heavier than my macbook air as that was an ultrabook and therefore shouldnt be compared to something outside of its weight class,0
2907,it was worth the price and even with its regular price point its still worth it,0
2908,hopefully asus will stand behind this computer as we have spent hours installing removing and reinstalling our personal data update may asus recommended to restore computer as it may have returned from asus with a virus,1
2909,i have to send it back to asus again and they wont even arrange for a fedex pickup i have to box it up and drive in to a fedex shipping center,0
2910,ive spent my life e mailing draft versions back and forth to myself to have access to them when im not at home,0
2911,therere complaints about it not having bluetooth but bluetooth usb dongle costs about dollars or less so i dont think its a problem,0
2912,well i guess it would be easier to squeeze into my carry on bag if it didnt have that slight peak but thats just a nit,1
2913,less than months after buying the video card went out acer xs told me what to do and it didnt work wiped out all my data,0
2914,the previous version also had the option of gb of ram which should be just standard with a chrome os device nowadays also you got g lte,0
2915,being a college student i needed a computer that would meet my academic needs play music and allow me to post on social media,0
2916,gpu never rises above c so i would assume it is cpucpu fan issues not overall vent structure problems,0
2918,also did not know the return warranty was less than one month,0
2919,just know that this is for basic computing browsing the internet watching some youtube videos netflix social media writing up documents on either google drive or microsofts one drive formerly skydrive or photo shop editing using something like pixlr,0
2920,i guess for the price there was bound to be something missing,0
2921,i have set the internet connections to metered so that the automatic updating is blocked from using memory during regular usage,0
2922,my last computer was a dell latitude e with a core i processor gb of ddr ram and a gb ssd,0
2923,the computer is silent the usb slots are on the back the sd card sticks out the side,0
2924,the last laptop my wife had was a sony vaio that lasted over years,0
2925,ssd also consumes less power,0
2926,if you need specific programs in your daily life this computer is not for you,0
2927,i went to the store and actually bought two stream laptops because there was a discount on the second hp laptop that you buy,0
2928,i managed to pause the video i took and shared a screenshot with you you can see that the windows split up and the bottoms left side is a mess,0
2929,battery seems to last forever,0
2930,blue screen several times,0
2932,this was basically a year and a half rental and back to the store i go,0
2934,ive had a couple hp chromebooks used at tradeshows a few years back,0
2935,hopefully i just got a default battery and not all the batterys are like that,1
2936,the aluminum is darker than the macbook air by a few shades sort of like a lead color on a piece of white paper,0
2937,the windows update ran for hours and was stuck on for the last hours,0
2938,no optical drive but this is less of an issue than it was a few years ago,0
2939,from power on to login prompt in less than seconds,0
2940,then last week the port where the charger goes is sometimes works and sometimes doesnt but that doesnt matter when the battery cant even hold a charge anymore and it can not stay on longer than minutes,0
2941,i couldnt install android apps on the sd card and the internal storage is very limited,0
2942,lastly this a processor is comparable to an i you can look it up on cpuboss,0
2943,this is less of an os review than hardware,0
2944,broke and would not power on in less than seven months,0
2945,all in all im happy to be the one to claim that some of the early issues reported here are not present in my machine so hopefully recent hardware and firmware fixes have been successful in fixing power up issues,1
2947,in fact copying a gb video file from a tb external drive to the internal firecuda drive went faster than it takes you to read this sentence,0
2948,however my last three windows laptops sony hp and lenovo all have had hardware issues so i decided to give a mac a try,0
2949,i just sent the notebook back for the third time for the same problem and have spent an additional sending it in for factory warranty,0
2950,if there were a score less than one i would give the dell inspiron series a zero,0
2951,he connected laptop to external monitor and updated operating system and drivers without success,0
2952,keyboard is not lit setting up a printer on the chromebook is a drag and requires you to either have a newer printer that supports googles cloud print or you need another windows pc or mac logged onto chrome at all times so your chromebook can print through them,0
2953,they said my case was already escalated to the highest priority with a red flag and customer relations would call me back by dec dec i sent an email to lenovo outlining the above complaints,0
2954,lenovo technical support diagnosed the laptop with a defective battery sent laptop and battery to the repair center and over one month later the laptop is still undergoing repair,0
2955,less the keyboardcons keyboard and the price maybe,0
2956,i have been using chrome os exclusively for the last two years,0
2957,all with less than gb used on a gb electronic drive,0
2958,overall this computer is definitely worth the money if you can spare it and a necessity for mobile gamers,0
2959,the battery life seems to last forever,0
2960,also i fully charged it this afternoon when i receive it and just a few hours later without being used the battery is at,0
2961,the battery life should last you up to hours when just streaming and listening to music on youtube,0
2962,i had my laptop shipped back over times for the same problem and customer care do not know how to handle the situation,0
2963,lasted me less than a year,0
2964,it just works no setting up thousands of optionsconsapple uses mini dvi port for projectors and or external monitors on the macbook pro uses regular dvi,0
2965,lastly the manner in which the touch pad is connected to the chassis of the laptop has me puzzled,0
2966,there were initial issues with the os installation and the acer specific software that would cause the system to crash,0
2968,dells customer service an oxymoron has been less than helpful,0
2969,if you are wondering if the touchscreen is worth it over the regular model it isnt however the extra ssd space is,0
2970,from pushing the power button to the login prompt took less than seconds also,0
2971,battery life i fully charged the thing and ive been making notes on some cases for the last two hours,0
2972,i gamed with it for a few hours but the next day it would not boot up,0
2973,i had my last laptop for years without incident not a lenovo,0
2974,just got it back from the depot yesterday and it took less than hours for the fan to go out again,0
2975,the second laptop i received had an issue after a couple days when pulled the screen closed it made a popping noise,0
2976,so think i would have kept it if i could have used the windows version of office i paid for less than a year ago,0
2977,three days of fairly regular usage before needing to be charged,0
2978,one wasted day of trying trying to get drivers working and i very correctly waved the white flag and packaged it back up,0
2979,i bought this product last week from bestbuy,0
2980,so now they keyboard has no battery life and i have to regularly charge it,0
2981,i believe they are nothing but a warehouse in california with foreign workers who could care less about their customers,0
2982,i think that a battery should be able to last an entire flight,1
2983,i would never listen to music or have a movie on in the background the battery would last thirty minutes,0
2984,this computer worked for less than one year before the lcd screen went out,0
2985,i traded up to this computer from an asus that had slightly less ram,0
2986,i will purchase it and upgrade a few of the components like memory and later the storage drive,0
2987,this is less than a year of owning the laptop,0
2988,this makes the screen less usable than something at x native,0
2989,refurbished product seems to come with a lot less bloatware,0
2990,i can go from typing a report on the keyboard to scribbling and highlighting with the stylus in less then seconds,0
2991,if you want to reinstall windows or upgrade to pro its just like installing it on a regular computer and asus provides all the required drivers on their site to do so,0
2992,it would be nice to have a cd drive but its not something i use later,1
2994,im a white collar professional a part time graduate student and also spend a lot of weekends on the road visiting friends out of town,0
2995,it comes with a samsung sm m gb pci express internal solid state drive ssd mzhpvhdgl,0
2996,i had to go back to a previous session which in turn made me lose several programs i had already loaded,0
2997,ive owned both computers for less than a week and hopefully this review will make your decision easier,0
2998,hopefully the warranty process will be much better,1
2999,packaging used to be nicer and classier than this back when i had the mx r no add ons or complementary items like a mouse pad or a cap which both ive got a few years back when i got my previous laptop,0
3000,it will make life so much easier next semester just wish i had it last semester,0
3001,lastly the laptop comes with a ton of bloatware so you may want to reset windows in which case heres the link to the drivers http www,0
3002,the trackpad is much better than on the first generation model but still nowhere close to apples its jerky not as precise as the name precision trackpad would suggest and if you rest your thumb on it by accident it doesnt respond when you try to control the pointer with your other finger whereas the mac trackpad is smart enough to overlook the resting thumb,1
3003,touchscreen capability becomes second nature after a few months,0
3004,overall if youre looking for a midrange machine with an included dvdcd readwrite drive this is a solid contender,0

3248,since this is only a minor cosmetic issue i didnt detract any stars but it would be nice to have fixed for other users,1
3249,i know i replied to this message weeks ago but i have not received any help so far the manufacturer seems to think that its your problem and the people of your and say i have to deal with the manufacturer who wants me to send it to texas because the screen is set to its minimal brightness so its impossible to configure the computer unless i can configure it i can not actually change the screen brightness because the function keys do not work unless they are attached to windows ive tried everything i can to fix it so if you could give me some advice on sending it back to you or perhaps you sending me another one so i have a box to send it back in that would be great because i just got back from vacation and i have to review this machine to see if were going to buy a hundred of them for a company but the moment its starting to look like were not going to bother because they dont have tech support but i do on this one and i would like it to work so if you can sort something out that would be great and if you can at least grant me the decency of a reply thank you very much,1
3250,one thing it would be nice to have another color besides white,1
3251,avoid this product after less than months of use the screen has gone faulty,0
3252,there wasnt one of these on either of my last three computers,0
3253,in looking in the computers history i saw that the last update was in,0
3254,i have spent hours on the phone with tech support including shipping it back to them twice,0
3255,the computer itself is very solid and well built it feels a lot sturdier than my former dell z which i paid double for,0
3256,as time went on the life was about hours with regular use,0
3257,we needed a second computer to use for our home business when both of us need to be on a computer at the same time,0
3258,believe me you will atleast be ahead of competition for next few years,0
3259,its so portable because of the size and openingclosing to life that id just throw it in my leather work bag or purse and scratched the outside a tad,0
3260,my only con about the backlit which is nowhere near a dealbreaker is the keys get alittle hot from the light or the heat fan im not surethe fan is quiet and its in the back so it wont burn you the only time it gets hot is when your in high power mode playing a game using nvidia graphics but using the intel graphics you wont feel the heat at allwith the intel graphics my games are alittle laggy but its intel so its much better than older graphics but can still max out some games with only little stutters of lagthe screen viewing angles are great you can see from every angle with no glare due to its ips screenthe back logo lights up which is cool eyecandythe keys arent slippery there nice so when i type fast i have no problem and my fingers dont slide on to other keysif i was to be nitpicky the only thing id probably complain about is i just wish this had one more usb slot but thats nothing serious you can buy an external one and when you first have it its alittle slow and laggy because the isnt updated fully you just need to update win then that issue will go awayupdating to win is great but you must reinstall the atk package and other programs to make sure it works on windows asus face id doesnt work on windows just go to asus websiter put in your model and installlastly its an energy saver laptop which is great it saves eletrical powerthis pc is not heavy and would be great for travel the only issue is the subwofer its actually alittle bit bigger than what it looks like in the pic to carry that around with the asus is alittle annoying but the sound boost is worth it the hotspots on the pc are in vry great places so you dont get burned when using the pc its above the keyboard which is a great spot and the screen gets alittle hot but the only way the pc will get hot is if you game on it so you wont be using touch for gaming so that eliminates that problemoverall this pc is amazing and you should buy it i highly recommend anyone to buy it this laptop is worth every penny just do your research contact the seller and make sure they are selling you whats in the desc and if it matches then buy it dont buy something used and expect everything to run like new being cheap will only end you up with a problem that you have to fix,1
3261,i spent over for a computer to not even last one year,0
3262,the speedy solid state drive uses way less battery and the laptop operated over hrs on a charge,0
3263,the replacement refurb flex would no longer turn onpower up after less than weeks,0
3264,there is a mini dock that comes with the laptop that provides a usb c dc input one hdmi port and one regular usb port,0
3265,had one few years ago provided by my job when i retired i didnt feel i could afford one so i bought another hplasted less than years before it crashed,0
3266,i often find myself pinching to zoom which also makes the screen size much less of a problem,0
3267,were sent to a support web site that did not work subsequent one hour chat straightened that out,0
3268,used less than a year,0
3269,touch pad sticks and makes screeching noise when you depress caps locks button you have to depress multiple times to make it work back lid of the screen uneven,0
3270,three months after that previous service she hadnt used it for several weeks and when she went to verify the battery level before going on a trip it wouldnt boot up,0
3271,for those with whom you share your chrome device regularly you can add them to the list of permanent users,0
3272,this represents an area in which dell will hopefully make improvements in its next gen model,1
3273,hopefully some kind of resolution will be forthcoming,1
3274,the battery seems to last her all day,0
3275,it is now running on windows and still has the same multiple daily system crashes,0
3276,it has less memory than my cell phone,0
3277,i used a hulking beast of a laptop up until last week when its battery charge holding capabilities became virtually non existant,0
3278,the lenovo brand is solid and seem to be built to last,0
3279,i bought one of these for my wife last year an just bought this one for my teenager so she can do her homework without stealing my work laptop,0
3280,the computer had no charge when i got it but it took less than an hour to charge to once i plugged it in,0
3281,the laptop was checked on the local lenovo service center and they charged me to import the spare screen and replace it,0
3282,it was in sale for last year which is a steal,0
3283,not recommended at all the screen stopped working in less than months,0
3284,i bought this because i have the samsung chromebook in september of last year which my wife didnt think she would like,0
3285,they called me less than hours after the case was opened another big plus but they had my laptop registered to someone else and i had to call them back when i had the laptop in front of me,0
3286,in addition this laptop is anything but quite as soon as there is any load on the cpu or gpu seems like there always is with windows the fan sounds like there is a monsoon happening outside i have yet to dink with the power settings,0
3287,i have owned several or less computers,0
3288,my regular computer is a in laptop which is too big to lug around a lot and is bulky to use in bed,0
3289,the next step to fix the issues is to go to the device manager and find the wacom driver under the human input category,0
3290,screen went out in less than monthsits still lights up but is blank,0
3291,physically the outer case of it the back side of the screen has a visible dent in it,0
3292,i wish the screen size was a little bigger,1
3293,what a mistake my macbook crashed on me after less than months taking me hours to read forums reinstalling the os and recovering from a time machine backup,0
3294,i got years out of my last asus,0
3295,there was no outside damage to the screen,0
3296,lastly there is no external audio input for recording or a mic input either,0
3297,edge stopped downloading several times and on the last attempt i was informed that it would take hours to finish downloading,0
3298,last toshiba product i ever buy from them,0
3299,i think my phones display looks way better than the laptop chrome os can be a bit confusing but it doesnt take too long to learn and get used to chrome os could use a little improvement no doubt it will definitely get better as time progresses a larger screen would be nice but would probably make it a bit more expensive you cant really store any local files considering the fact that it only has gb of storage,1
3300,seemed to perform well but the buttons for the mouse were hollow and it was like it wasnt well made maybe a part was missing under the buttons,0
3301,windows was not installed properly therefore i had to send it back,0
3302,at school i can have multiple items on the screen and listen to music all at the same time,0
3303,and i dont think it will last one year,0
3304,it served me well for the last years and i never thought id go back to a pc,0
3305,actually since the update my display driver has been failing less,0
3307,i would have rated this stars if the battery charge would last about hours,0
3308,watching on netflix in chrome barely last hours,0
3309,runs counter strike global offensive at a solid fps,0
3310,buy a dell so you have something to use while the warranty department sends it back any forth never actually fixing it,0
3311,update after three month of daily useprosweight you barely feel if your bag,0
3312,and the battery last,0
3313,still using it regularly three years later,0
3314,there is not a disk drive although in this day and age next to nothing needs a disk drive if you do the user can purchase an external unit,0
3315,but the highpoint l has ports instead of comes with cables and costs less at here on amazon,0
3316,i believe this is one of the last models if not the last that has the cd drive built in with all the ports,0
3317,because the battery was integrated i couldnt replace it myself so i had to return it and get a second computer of the same model,0
3318,i had intel wifi hardware on my last laptop and never had these issues,0
3319,the outside surface opposite from the screen has what appear to be two copper looking lines,0
3320,a few years back i wanted a macbook air,0
3321,a few hours later they would turn on but still would not turn on,0
3322,less storage shorter battery life and slower processor,0
3323,i wish i could use the documents without needing wifi so i could take notes on it overall worth the price,0
3324,i assume a manufacturing issue as there is no external screen damage on the front or back of the lcd panel,0
3325,now a year later the same issue happened again out of warranty this time,0
3326,lastly if you do decide to get this notebook and upgrade it with an ssd drive remember that you must initialize the drive under windows disk management before windows or the notebook can see it,0
3327,has a slightly stronger graphics card but its a pain to setup since a later update made it stop working,0
3328,you are left with needing to use an sd card reader usb to add space so that windows can continue to try to update with an external drive,0
3329,this was their last chance this computer is being returned and i am getting something from another manufacturer,0
3330,had it less than a month and twice i had to do a powerwash on it,0
3331,i wish the screen was a little larger with less bezel but thats a minor nit,1
3332,just couldnt get used to the unfamiliarity of the programs which would not have been a problem except that i am dealing with several health issues all at the same time,0
3334,one it doesnt support itunes which is fine but it would be great if it did,1
3335,im reality there are multiple dents in the side and big crease in one side of the screen,0
3336,stopped working after less than a year recovery app wouldnt work asus said i have to send it in then days after recieved for repair wouldnt send replacement or recovery flash drive,0
3337,this is second battery in the laptop and it is the same behaviour,0
3338,it does the job but its works slower than my last computer,0
3339,update ive occasionally had an issue where i cant turn the computer back on using the power button,0
3340,i dont know if its a result from me accidentally dropping it and breaking off the two usb ports i had an external hhd plugged in at the time on the left side,0
3341,after the purchase i have found this computer for less at local office supply stores,0
3342,i paid for touchscreen but its just a regular screen,0
3343,my point is that the less than helpful bt functionality doesnt seem to be the fault of the hardware rather its a limitation of the os,0
3344,consthere is no back lit keyboard which i have never actually had however i can see this being beneficial to any laptop user,0
3345,i then tried to roll back to the previous system image within the gb recovery partition by pressing f when the system started,0
3346,so for instance if you want to store your google play music and movies on your chromebook youre currently limited to the internal memory,0
3347,after my warranty is over which is less than yr felt cheated on this,0
3348,makes me wonder what else is missing going to pick another brand after this experience,0
3349,unlike my regular laptop the zenbook seems to have an internal battery,0
3350,i have spent over hours on support with lenovo trying to get windows pro back on this machine,0
3351,btw being an asus user for year that is was my last asus product,0
3352,last year i bought a toshiba laptop for one of my sons for school,0
3353,chrome os also means no virus solid state drive makes your boot time literally seconds gb of ram is plenty for people with less than tabs,0
3354,for reference the last review is copied below i am writing this while sitting at an airport in phuket trying to run excel on the surface book and having it lag the beejesus out of the machine,0
3355,you are going to say well i guess grandmas christmas jammies she knitted me last year could have gone in my checked suitcase on this leg of the trip,0
3356,ive seen my brother in law sitting outside for hours without plugging it in,0
3357,that way maybe the battery will last a while,0
3358,i ordered one of these opened the cover and there was an error message on the screen chrome os is missing or damaged,0
3359,he tried everything and the last try took it hours yes hours to finish and yet didnt work,0
3360,but im not expecting missing part,0
3361,last straw was when the micheadphone port stopped working,0
3362,it would be great for students a second computer or for anyone who is just looking to have the ability to get online and access basic programs,1
3363,also the battery can last over hours sometimes over hours depends,0
3364,tf card for those outside the us,0
3365,keyboard is about the same as the asus and this model isnt back lit,0
3366,less than a year,0
3367,i have owned this laptop for year and months which is just outside the warranty period,0
3368,i played this at work on a hour shift when our ac went out in tx while its degrees outside,0
3369,seems i had a month to return to amazon so no luck there less than hours and i received a reply email from asus customer service with a link to start the rma process,0
3370,i then called back and spent minutes on the phone about minutes on hold w a tech who initially spent minutes trying to instruct me on where to find the hibernation setting in windows and eventually advising me i could resolve the problem by setting the computer to never go into sleep or hibernation mode after being turned on,0
3371,it is a few people spamming pretending to be multiple people having this screen issue,0
3372,i was up and running in two evenings and back to actual productive work on the second evening,0
3373,im hoping this laptop will last me years,0
3374,price should be less than,0
3375,customer service is a joke barely speak english and troubleshoot from a piece of paper,0
3376,now i noticed that the battery doesnt last anymore even when i charge it overnight,0
3377,i just received this computer and have spent the last days removing disabling lenovo programs that interfere with my web browsing,0
3378,i looked at the gb but for the price i would suggest getting the,1
3379,the bestpurchase i made for gaming computers in the last years,0
3380,it would also be helpful to have a distinct physical bar separating the a key from the caps lock reminding the user of unique key locationsnitpicking thoughts both the i and gtx stickers were unevenly placed mismatched angles compared to the keyboard ships with near gb on a recovery partition,1
3381,whenever something breaks we call up dell technical support and their warranty services fix it next business day thats what we use,0
3382,it arrived yesterday and i had it installed in less then minutes,0
3383,well the last time mine did it it blinked the power led times and would not come up,0
3384,the speakers will not work if you have had headphones plugged in since the last time you restarted and the graphics driver stops working about once a day,0
3385,ya it would be nice to have that also be an ssd but with the gb ram in this i dont really mind it much at this point,1
3386,the computer did not last days,0
3387,it would be better partitioned to gb for windows so that you have the remaining gb for data but oh well that can be done if needed later,1
3388,i still dislike the fact that you cant drag and drop a file from google drive to dropbox,0
3389,my asus laptop isnt doing well with travel the frame isnt holding up well so i needed something else that will get me through my last couple semesters of class and then my internship,0
3390,ordered of these to use for tutoring at local youth center of them have had battery failures within days from receipt,0
3391,theres also a sd card storage slot which ive added a gb card to for extra local storage if i need it,0
3392,i was traveling a lot so i figured it would be nice to have a prettylightweight laptop with a full keyboard that i could use to do emails basic web browsing and google docs,1
3393,the white screen is strange and displays squares of multicolored pixels all over it,0
3394,one of them would no longer turn on after less than a week of use maybe hours of screen time,0
3395,i just purchased this laptop and its been out of the box for less than hours,0
3396,no moving parts also means less to break,0
3397,i have used the macbook air for the last three years as a middle school teacher,0
3398,it seemed like it would be great if it had arrived in working order,1
3399,again i spend over minutes filtering through departments with individuals who barely speak english and need to transfer me or put me on hold,0
3400,lower power consumption and less heat than spinning harddrives,0
3401,but after less than a year the hinge on the laptop broke,0
3402,overall for the price this samsung chromebook is definitely worth it,0
3403,i could last for hour while listening to music w earphones programming in visual studios,0
3404,flies thru everything i throw at it months later i started getting a red line down the screen bummer and without getting the warranty im out of luck,0
3405,x on a laptop is simply not good enough by s standards so hopefully we see some new higher resolution displays from apple in the next year,1
3406,i probably wont upgrade memory any more but it would be nice to have the option,1
3407,i have a cooling fan in one an external usb port hub in one and a mouse dongle in the third,0
3408,i like that the network internet page tells me my data usage for the last days,0
3409,once it is charged it will last for five or six hours without a re charge,0
3410,the last windows computer i bought was back in,0
3411,powers up in about seconds battery life is around hours depending on usage and i streamed a p hd moivie last night,0
3412,barely months later i took it out to prepare for a presentation and it wont take a charge or power from the ac cord,0
3413,i wish all computer problems were this easy to solve,1
3414,i have to see if it last longer than a month before making an assessment of the product,0
3415,i havent had any problems or computer errors at all i took off a star because this does not last hours on battery,0
3416,it draws about w or less while in use with a charged battery compared to almost w from my custom gaming pc,0
3417,then what brand chromebook then was it worth the extra for this toshiba over their gb standard res version,0
3418,you can get a gb ssd the extra gigs of memory and the hdd caddy for easily less than combined if you shop around,0
3419,i printed the label and left the package outside before i went to work the next morning,0
3420,i received the gb model of the asus chromebook flip last week having pre ordered through another online retailer,0
3421,again asus says i need to send it back and they promise to actually replace the computer and not just send me back the pos i was sold,0
3422,as you can see in the product description the laptop is supposed to last up to hours on a charge,0
3423,i installed a third party wireless router and configured internet services on the macbook in a few minutes,0
3424,now with a separate speaker to lug around the compact size has much less value,0
3425,he offered me expidited shipping on to send the computer back in for service on the same unit,0
3426,boots to home screen in seconds or less,0
3427,the directions are cryptic and the last frame asks you to change the bios but doesnt say what,0
3428,i bought this last year on september th,0
3429,amazon gave me the choice to order the same computer again or just get my money back,0
3430,next the following shipment arrived with a defective battery,0
3431,i can load up my computer from power off and be playing a biggame like dragons dogma in seconds probably less,0
3432,i wont rehash all the technical stuff that is already stated in the description,0
3433,in summary if you dont mind to spend for a computer that last one year go ahead and buy it you will be please,0
3434,i couldnt get it anywhere else for the price outside of amazon,0
3435,folks who dont know how to replace a driver might have to spend an extra at their local computer shop to get this cleaned up,0
3436,this computer has lasted me over a year and a half now through the bushveld of southern africa during my fieldwork days and beyond,0
3437,if you want to download external programs outside of google then it wont work,0
3438,a denotes an attribute in the dells favor and a denotes an advantage to the t dell i vs asus t larger screen size vs both at x resolution roomier keyboard that is much easier to type on more flexible screen i wish i could tilt the t screen back another degrees more memory and is user upgradable more storage and is user upgradable much faster charging t uses microusb charger which is slow faster cpu pentium n vs atom z or the older z shorter battery life hours vs hours heavier especially in tablet form bulkier power supply and uses a pronged power cord worse build quality dell uses soft plastics and the finish scratches easily higher street price at time of this reviewall in all i really like the dell,1
3439,the tablet introduction a few years ago killed the netbook market,0
3440,i purchased this computer for my daughter this time last year for school,0
3441,buy from lenovo and not a third party so you are actually supported,0
3442,will purchase this model again hopefully these issues will get resolved,1
3443,the battery last for about hours,0
3444,though i would say my actual use time is about hours per day some times less,0
3445,if you are a regular person like me you will spend hours going through through the help forums on lenovos web site,0
3446,not one product i have bought from hp in the last years has worked as advertised,0
3447,if you do not like the style of windows it still has the regular windows look to it as well for the desktop,0
3448,it has been sent back to samsung twice to be fixed and has been returned usable for a few hours and then back to the same error message,0
3449,perhaps they thought it is not going to make much difference but believe it or not chromebooks are quite useful to copy data from one place to another e g pictures from flash drives to external drives and movies from external drives to flash drives and a faster interface will be quite useful here,0
3450,sounds like they are trying to drag it out until year warranty has lapsed,0
3451,again my advice dont spend the money get another computer for less and with less problems,0
3452,when i turn the computer on or wake it up from sleep it loads up in probably less than seconds,0
3454,stopped working in less than a year,0
3455,this thing didnt even last me a year the touchscreen barely made it three months,0
3456,ive had to do a computer refreshreset twice already and ive had this computer less than weeks,0
3457,on initial bootup the cpu is already running at every few seconds,0
3458,well let me take that back i just went and opened up netflix to get the name of the missing driver and it is now working,0
3459,i still have all of the hp laptops i have purchased over the last years they all still work,0
3460,its still operative after two years even though its missing bits now,0
3461,since it has a metal edge i am worried it will get caught on something and break the drive and or outside case,0
3462,this model should come with a warning label do not purchase for any reason,1
3463,pro vs regular the pro is faster and for an extra i wanted the extra speed,0
3464,compared to my last pc updates powering on and opening programs are times faster,0
3465,im going to try just a regular windows op system like im used to and not even try another chrome book,0
3466,computer is acting up and screen is not functioning properly,0
3467,keyboard and touchscreen already has problems less than one year using,0
3468,after getting it i realized that didnt have a regular hdmi port and also didnt have a memory card reader,0
3469,for lighter workloads and if you use the intel p state governor for dynamic cpu frequency adjustment that can be stretched to another hour or two,0
3470,when i asked farat herman client technical support specialist why he could not track my laptops location at the warehouse his initial response was that it probably was re issued to another customer,0
3472,sent it back they fixed it two months later the battery died again,0
3473,my friend bought a pro last year and when i showed him this he thought it was an air,0
3474,added another gb of ram in less than a couple of minutes,0
3475,still need to get used to the chrome os missing programs and online apps,0
3476,when the laptop was received from asus the solid state drive was there but the terabyte drive was not correctly configured and appeared to be missing,0
3477,asus wants the price of the laptop to bring it back to life not worth it,0
3478,what reassurance do i have if the notebook is repairedreplaced but the same problems reoccur but outside of the year warranty window,0
3479,when gaming you get less than an hour,0
3480,it has the macbook esque ability that allows you to immediately start using it from where you left off if you just closed the laptop lid instead of powering off i really like this feature and it doesnt waste battery or anything to do this,0
3481,my mode of operation is to have my thumb on the left mouse button and my index finger doing the tracking but with this style of trackpad that tends to result in misclicks and slightly incorrect highlights,0
3482,no issues encountered and i was back up and running in less than an hour on the samsung drive,0
3483,if i had to go back to windows id get a dell with their gold premier whatever enhanced technical support and on site service,0
3484,lastly it has a blu ray drive which i missed in the specs when i ordered it,0
3485,slowest laptop i have seen in last years out of the box,0
3486,i am an international student and i had exams last week,0
3487,i expect this machine to last me to years so im looking forward to next gen programs,0
3488,i understand the reason it drives up cost but to me having an ssd in this system would make it even faster and make the battery last longer,0
3489,we got this for my mom she wanted a tablet but there are non that have a usb port so we got her this the keyboard has a usb port and i also got her a converter for her memory chip for her camera now she can surf the net and look at her pictures and do all she needs and wants on the internet,0
3490,next morning i contacted asus and was told that the subwoofer was not covered under the warranty for physical damage,0
3491,just hoping that it would last a few years,0
3492,installed windows in less about minutes,0
3493,the asus customer folks told me it would be to repair the laptop after the first failure and same cost just for the boot disc when i could have bought a refurbished entire laptop for the same price so i went with the local tech,1
3494,also the keyboard feels hollow when you type on it like you are going to push into the chassis of the notebook,0
3495,does everything a regular computer can,0
3496,this is the fourth laptop same make and model weve purchased in our family,0
3497,a year and a half later i bought the version of the macbook pro,0
3498,i decided not to get the touch screen because of the glare and smudges i had to deal with with my last laptop,0
3499,i didnt order in my name but it was ordered in the same last name for me,0
3500,i bought this computer last year for my husband,0
3501,this would be my last acer product,0
3502,i am in the process of sending the computer back a third time for the very same problem,0
3503,i was taken to the same screen multiple times that read something like we are setting things up for you,0
3504,but man all of the features i paid over g for before i now have for less than plus i get bluetooth and a touchscreen,0
3505,it would be nice if the hdmi port was a full sized one,1
3506,i was considering a macbook macbook air and macbook pro but i didnt want to pay an arm a few toes and a lot of money for an apple product that does the same thing or even has less specs than the asus zenbook,0
3507,it would be nice if the keyboard was backlit but i understand thats asking too much of a computer for the gb model which i highly recommend for only about more than the model with half the memory,1
3508,it would be helpful to have another computer or tablet so you can look at manual and google questions,1
3509,in short and answering most of doubts that tapeworm before buying it they would be if to bring before wifi like everything portable one at present the controler or integrated it is of mark realtek hence it always goes to have support since this manufacturer of integrated performs the best thing for software or support of software if for x or y reason hp does not give any more in version later of windows or thinking to future with an excellent sign reception i have it on a second floor enough distance from which the modem is and without problems it manages the sign if to bring reading unit of dvd and quemadora of dvd not to bring bluray since the price is just and works perfectly if it brings to mount more memory ram at present it has a module gb ddr or mhz of mark hyundai in the integrated ones lets say that alone good behaves that for the processor and configuration of bios and card mother covers the module to mhz if to bring webcam and is relatively good for the price that is paid,1
3510,i kept testing out the laptop to try and figure out what was up and in the process i got several bsods and the battery strangely went from to while the laptop was just sitting on my desk for a couple of hours,0
3511,i had this computer for less than four hours and its already blue screened i am furious,0
3512,i bought this laptop not from amazon as it my previous lenovo yoga flex screen would go blank and flicker again and again,0
3513,note i had never upgraded this laptop to an ssd so i can not comment there i did not use the speakers a whole lot since i was in a location where headphones would be better suited though with my sonys which in large part is a to the headphones the sound was great the overall matte look is something i really liked too access to the bottom is something i loved too remove two basic phillips head screws and you can easily access the hdd ram and even the fan which if you needed to take it out and clean it or replace it looks like it would be a peace of cake this doesnt apply to all people but i have not had a single issue with any linux distribution i had thrown at it overall every single one worked flawlessly with this laptop once i made a few bios changes like turning off secure boot,1
3514,the touchscreen has no useful gestures which is not really asus fault its just like damn nobody thought of useful ways to use this thing,0
3515,ive had the battery last for hours some periods without wi fi on,0
3516,when i got the computer back after weeks it still has the same problem,0
3517,im looking forward to seeing what happens over the next few years,0
3518,i bought a surface pro with them last year and went back for a dell xps i version,0
3519,i use videoconferencing regularly for work and i have to borrow another computer to do it now,0
3520,october technician came to my house with the motherboard took it apart to find out that dell did not include the proper heatsink she put the case back on in a rush and left,0
3521,seeing as to how my blade is now outside the year warranty i think i am stuck living with this issue,0
3522,i was installing multiple programs at the same time and man must i say the thing ran like a champ,0
3523,unclear of what needs to be done we bought it less than year ago,0
3524,one item i wish it had was back lit keys for typing in the dark but you can not have it all for a machine that costs,1
3525,if you dont mind spending the cost of the drive and you find one that is mm or less in thickness you could replace the drive by removing the bottom screws on this laptop,0
3526,for the price less than its a winner,0
3527,eta it would cost to repair the cracked lcd screen its not cracked on the outside so something must have cracked on the inside,0
3528,as you read the support pages you see how several customers actually did send their laptops probably out of the return period to the service center and had screens and motherboards replaced,0
3529,i cant believe ive put up with regular disk drives all this time,0
3530,i regularly use the usb port with a gb usb flash drive where i store music and files i need and it works well,0
3531,so now my system is in fact touch less now,0
3532,lastly i know some others had confusion about whether it was an i or i i bought the i because of the price difference,0
3533,i have had two chromebooks over the last few years,0
3534,lastly anything i want to save to a local drive i just save to a memory stick,0
3535,i am no computer expert but my last laptop was an acer,0
3536,it could scoot back and forth in the practically unpadded inner computer box in four directions seven or eight inches,0
3537,i had the gb model though and i did notice lag regularly with its rockchip processor,0
3538,i think the build is good but i wish the actual computer performance was also as good,1
3539,replacement computer second shipment did the same thing returned it,0
3540,the device battery gets charged in less than two hours and lasts approx,0
3541,this may be caused by charging over usb c instead of the regular ac port,0
3542,and now that ive had it for months the battery which used to last almost hours now barely lasts,0
3543,the last dell they had lasted for almost years,0
3544,they never inform you of the repair status the website warranty repair check in doesnt work so you have to go through asian foreign phone reps,0
3545,purchased a samsung chromebook xec kus gb ram gb ssd that was less than the asus,0
3546,have had problem with computer failing to start up properly have contacted dell support who now state there is a day warranty and i should ship the computer back to them to look it over,0
3547,this item is at the big red circle store through september that is a steal,0
3548,the battery by the way last for hours,0
3549,most importantly for me when you place a p screen on the computer it would be nice to be able to play p videos without stuttering which this laptop is unable to do,1
3550,trust me i tried calling the us service number and they wouldnt even talk to me once i told them i lived outside the us,0
3551,even if you check keep logged in on your regular chrome account youll have to login every time here,0
3552,and i just have not encountered the issues i have regularly with windows updates that dont work or take forever to load frozen screen shut downs you name it you know what i am talking about if you have ever owned a windows computer,0
3553,i purchased this for school because i am in my last year and my microsoft expired,0
3554,and do not buy it at the big computer store with the yellow sign,0
3555,the battery doesnt last up to hours as stated,0
3556,i purchased this item on promotion for but id think its worth the standard i see it listed for on amazon,0
3557,i knew that coming in but i think it would be nice to know whole process took place in vaio japan,1
3558,died in less than a year,0
3560,i like the hdmi output really useful for watching something on a big screen,0
3561,there are no signs of physical damage to either the back of the screen or the front of the screen but samsung says the screen is physically damage,0
3562,since i was outside and away from a wireless signal i turned off the wi fi at this time,0
3563,it turns out that the os load was faulty resulting in the blue screen of death several times a day,0
3564,upton turning it on it been loading software for last two hour,0
3565,and the way google drive is set up when you save its seamless and identical to saving on a local drive,0
3566,used it no issues screen closed opened back up minutes later and not so much as a drop of life in this thing,0
3567,understand though that my last computer was a dell dimension,0
3568,i also have had the computer for less than a year and am having charging issues,0
3569,i decided on the pro version over the regular model because of the longer warranty,0
3570,the matte screen makes reading and otherwise using the device outside easier as it reduces screen glare,0
3571,the laptop did not last even an year and when i went to get repaired the power supply ic was gone,0
3572,it functions but i have to pound on the keys and spacebar computer can barely handle microsoft visual studio for beginning coding classes yet it meets the minimum requirements set by my instructor and school i tried gaming on this wildstar and kingdom hearts i think dont try unless you have patience,0
3573,the second shows the disparity in text sizes between a shortcut on the desktop and the text in the same program,0
3574,so the battery life for me streaming youtube videos at p connected to an external pfps monitor and browsing brightness on the internal screen is hrs,0
3575,i had a lower tier acer for years and needed to upgrade i settled on this one as it met all my predicted needs and my previous acer really left nothing to be desired,0
3576,every time your kid touches the outer screen your mouse will move to his screen and you have to drag it back into your screen,0
3577,comacer chromebook heatsink cooler shen dpbqkvarefsrutfqidsr keywordsacercchromebookfanthe part cost went in with no problems in less than minutes,0
3578,overall though i did fix the issue within a few hours and residual software problems have diminished over the last week or so as microsoft continues to issue updates,0
3579,took less than five minutes to install and then just had to turn on the platform trust setting and enable the password in the bios,0
3580,computer is freezing last night froze on my son doing homework,0
3581,product was missing gb ssd,0
3582,either way i did not pay for a defective item and sent the thing back the following day,0
3583,the d was the last latitude model dell produced with a serial port in the back,0
3584,also come with a warranty that last through oct,0
3585,months later my daughter turns on her chromebook and it says something about a portion of chrome os is missing,0
3586,i had to tune the screen before the problems became less noticeable,0
3587,lastly the battery lasts about hours before needing recharging,0
3588,if i had to complain about something it would be that the battery runs out quickly but i tend to keep it plugged in anyway and even though the volume is good it could have been better but overall i would recommend this laptop,1
3589,barely last hours while streaming online videos,0
3590,it would be better to have a macintosh monitor for the high resolution to match the high resolution in the kirabook,1
3591,the plastic parts feel a bit looks and one of the plastic legs on the bottom is missing,0
3592,i bought the gb model but since my last one was almost maxed out i wish id bought the gb one,0
3593,as i have had some bad experience with such combos it would be nice to have a bluetooth combo delivered or at least tested and certified by dell,1
3594,finaly i had to send it back what a pain to start over as screen pixels just kept degrading center verticle lines,0
3595,the trick is to install it on a computer which has a dvdbd player hopefully you have one and then transfer the files onto a usb drive again hopefully you have one and then install it onto this computer,1
3596,in fact it does and allows the password program last pass without a problem,0
3597,i bought that computer last summer,0
3598,the warranty ended last month,0
3599,the track pad is not the greatest however most users may prefer to get a wireless mouse,1

3601,ive had this computer for less than three months and it already stopped turning on,0

3604,i have had this asus for less than year and i am having issues with it,0
3605,the day warranty from asus expired less than days after we purchased the units,0

3607,the back of the computer was a big finger print magnet,0
3608,lastly the battery will not charge up to unless you let it dip below and then charge it,0
3609,at a lower resolution versus the competition you benefit from less draw on the battery,0
3610,last one was the with nvidia processor proved to be a loser,0
3611,just bought a second one of these and am upping my review to stars on a for the money basis theyre now throwing in lifetime g for the same price,0
3613,meaning if you already have a surface book there is no need to upgrade to this because its relatively the same of its previous models,0
3614,buying a cloud based device and then slamming it because you need the internet would be like buying a cell phone and being upset that you need to have cellular service to use it,1
3615,in that time i worked in tech support sales and spent the last of my years there working on dell,0
3616,we bought my mother basically the same chromebook last year and its served her well so when my wifes computer bit the dust we went ahead and got her this chrome book,0
3617,a cd drive should be included doesnt matter if internal or external,0
3618,i know for a fact this system should be able to run this game fps no problem so i checked task manager and the cpu was being eaten up by windows defender and the system process,1
3619,it will last me again for the next five years like my old and still working hp computer did,0
3620,xx standard global shipping however my order has been cancelled few days later by amazon due to export restrictions reason,0
3621,i have tested this and yes it does last for hours of use,0
3622,i bought this computer less than one month ago,0
3623,the touch screen works admirably and i have not had any issues with switching back and forth between using on screen commands and regular keyboard or mouse commands,0
3624,and if you want them go drop an additional on a clunkier less efficient computer,0
3625,the actual computer however is less than desirable,0
3626,i spent about an hour clearing out the junk that acer left resident on the machine including the office app which i didnt need,0
3627,immediately shut it down and request an exchange from amazon pack it all back up and drive to town to send it back,0
3628,after a few uses while on vacation i got thechrome is missing or damaged screen,0

3632,yesterday it stopped working and displayed that the chrome os was missing or corrupted,0
3633,owned less than a year and the battery died,0

3638,i installed this immediately after purchasing my lenovo u touch laptop last january,0
3639,they had the package with the battery called back and once my fiance got a hold of a backup computer we returned the computer the same way it was sent to us,0
3640,overall a solid laptop for its price,0
3641,purchased next day on site repair option with my extended warranty but lenovo insists that i ship the unit to kentucky to theirrepair depot yet again and be without my computer for weeks took three weeks last time never buying this brand again,0
3642,i start using the computers in the student center as a back up,0
3643,if vnc worked better it would also be a great device to use,1
3644,when i read about it i noticed the limitations in the specs but after spending a lot of time on it all those supposed limitations are no where to be seen im loving the hp annr this would be a great computer for a student a newbie or someone that wants to use it the way i use it,1
3645,going into the latter part of my senior year i knew i wanted my next computer to be a gaming laptop and for people who dont know much about gaming laptops those things arent portable,0
3646,i went from basic hardware warranty specialist named sheena badge who transferred me back to out of warranty department,0
3647,the battery life can last to hours,0
3648,suggestion to acer please put in physical buttons in your next computer,0
3649,hopefully this will last me a few years so ill have my moneys worth,1

3651,cons it would be nice to have thunderbolt trackpad could be better some bugs with gigabyte smart update windows creators update not yet available in windows update,1
3653,battery life when was the last time you had a laptop which could run hours reliably,0
3654,i can read books through kindle cloud reader and the keyboard hinge on the side of the screen feels like pages folded to the back on an actual book,0

3660,in the meantime i just installed my games to the ssd and will move them when i get the missing hardware installed,0
3661,ive seen gb sdhc cards for sale here on amazon for less than,0
3662,when i opened up the chassis i noticed that some of the screws were missing and one of the fans popped out of place because it was missing the two screws that keep in place,0
3663,i used to stick with the lenovo thinkpads until their last model left be a bit wanting and i jumped ship,0
3664,if you can save by getting last years model that seems like a no brainer to me,0
3665,i dont think ive ever needed to max the brightness even as i sit outside typing this review,0
3666,did not last longer than six months and there is no warranty after,0
3667,another advice dont buy windows tablets with less than gb of ram,0
3668,minus star for yellow color problems,0
3669,one wish would be the usb port was on the side instead of the back but big deal,0
3671,the only downside is that the caps lock does not light up when you are changing from upper to lower case and it would be nice to have more than one each and usb ports but i dont use a lot of devices,1
3672,less than a year after its purchase,0
3673,this laptop offers a lot of storage and a built in dvd drive as well so i dont need to carry the extra driver all the time,0

3675,it has been a decade since the last time i purchased a computer,0

3679,this replaced an hp laptop that lasted less than years,0
3680,but no big deal i loaded office on the computer and here is the issue after loading a few software options for her daily use office adobe quicken printer drivers and hotspot driver the memory is just about tapped out,0
3681,the next shop i took it to told me the same thing but that they wouldnt refund my money if they ordered a screen and it didnt work,0
3682,this is a solid mid performing chromebook at a bargain price,0
3683,only two items i wish it had so far a bit of a plastic tab at the center edge of the lid to make it easier to open from the center dont think its a good idea to open from the corners and twist the lidscreen frame,1
3684,overall it is a laptop worth the price,0
3685,the photo is what mine looks like because of samsung not covering the warranty the screws missing are replaced with bolts and thats not even working because the plastics starting to crack around the bolts,0
3686,just beware this is a one year or less item,0
3687,i think given the overall benefits of a mac system this isnt a big deal at all but then again i think apples unwillingness to publish a substantial guide to its products basically is the reason why windows is still even a competitor for apple and people still are attached to pcs,0
3688,as im typing this review on the laptop my screen is flickering unless i leave the laptop plugged in support has been less than helpful,0
3689,the battery last up to three hours,0
3690,an extension cord can rectify this problem but who wants to carry one of those some performance issuesoccasionally my screen will turn all white while exploring the internet,0
3691,editi spent last night starting to get the computer set up,0
3692,it is a th generation processor but a core m none the less,0
3693,the dell you pay for the rugged design that will last you for years,0
3694,it means i have to stop my work and work my way backwards to see where the cursor jumped to the line above and it could be several lines above by that time garbling my typed information,0
3695,also someone left their leopard os for mac inside of the computer strange,0
3696,this computer didnt last two months the screen broke,0
3697,i had the larger version of an earlier model ux before this and always thought it would be great to have it slightly smaller so i can use it easily on the airplane and otherwise,1
3698,my last computer was a sony vaio that weighed lbs,0
3699,i have owned this chromebook for several years now and let me say this was a waste of every penny i spent,0
3700,when my last laptop had issues lenovo shipped me a box to send the computer in,0
3701,i wish a driver update could reverse dells decision to use the microsoft precision trackpad,1
3702,this resolution is ok for nearly every use but when i remote to our desktop pc which has large monitors it would be great to have higher resolution,1
3703,a child can destroy an operating system in no time flat,0

3711,battery life seems to be way less hrs than stated hrs though,0
3712,my last laptop all you had to do was hold your hand over it and the mouse pointer shot across the screen,0
3713,i thought it was a regular laptop but its just a computer for just the internet,0
3714,well made and should last for year,0
3715,this computers mouse was frozen in the same spot for two months until we sent it back,0
3716,i wish i had thoroughly checked the dell website before buying on amazon because later i saw the same product for a couple of hundred dollars less,0
3717,i guess the battery will last longer if i am not actually using the computer,0
3718,i purchased this computer a few months ago and as soon as my warranty ended to send it back the computer decided that the usb port would no longer work,0
3719,the laptop was already tampered with because it was missing a screw but there is a warranty but the company still wants to put the charger port back inside which looked as if it was glued on,0
3721,eleven hours after trying to set up this product with the assistance of others we eventually decided to ship it back to amazon the following day,0
3722,second time loading the laptop and its stuck on the blue screen,0
3723,took it back to best buy they sent it off it came back in less than two weeks with a replaced screen and no charge because they deal with samsung so i dont have to,0
3724,if you are looking for a budget laptop that allows you to network run social media move files around with an external harddrive then this is your chromebook,0
3725,at the third week i had a few bsods while running on battery power not plugged in,0
3726,take my advice and look elsewhere or you will end up computer less and with less money in your pockets,0
3727,again it works but it would be nice to see a tidier lighting system,1
3728,i did that and a few weeks later received a call telling me that my computer issues were not covered under the warranty but that i could pay to have them shipped,0
3729,it boots up in less time than it takes me to get seated after pressing the power button,0
3730,thismodel has a charcoal color keyboard deck amazon stocks a few modelswith white decks,0

3737,last years model had some issues and this years model comes with the kaby lake cpu and gtx,0
3738,i got this for my son for christmas last year,0

3743,bought this notebook last year,0
3744,i paid almost times this for my last laptop and it barely lasted two years,0
3745,the laptop is a battery quenches it will last you about hours or hours max if youre at maximum eco usage,0
3746,and of course these issues were noticed outside of the return and support window,0
3747,instead keep as much outside the box as usb etc,0
3748,the battery will not last for hours note that the screen brightness is not to the max,0
3749,the screen isnt touchscreen and its just a regular laptop,0
3750,the inch weighs less than pounds and i find the air to be just as portable as my ipad and i no longer have to tote around the extra keyboard,0
3751,additionally it loses connectivity to the internet on a daily basis and freezes regularly,0
