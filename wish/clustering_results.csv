17,0.999996167,0,the last option was to try to reset windows something that the computer itself recommended to get it back to factory settings

31,0.99545528,0,i received my replacement laptop and downloaded even less onto this computer
21,1,1,performance it would be nice to have skylake or even broadwell under the hood for what it retails for i wouldnt pay retail or even close to it for this setup nm vs nm physical footprint should see about an hour increase in battery life yada yada but for my purposes no significant difference other than the psychological win
17,0.630170281,0,my package took less than a day to fulfill
9,0.999943436,0,the ram coupled with the ssd though and you get a machine that boots in seconds opens apps in less than a second and has a sizeable amount of on board storage
7,0.999999997,0,there doesnt seem to be a way to load anti virus on it so i cant tell if that is the issue but it just crashed for about the three hundredth time in the last three months and lost part of a story i was working on

19,1,1,all in all if i only had to have one computer i would prefer the mac but like i said i am using both machines every day at this point and use them both equally for writing email and web browsing
23,0.999989842,0,it will do school work and the battery last all day without having to charge it
39,1,1,however if you want a what could be improved in later models list a x resolution would be welcomed while gb of ram gets the job done it would be nice to see gb an inch screen could easily fit in the same overall space and would make this an even better comparable to small laptops better battery life would always be welcome a second full usb port on the other side of the keyboard would largely improve the laptop utility
15,0.999999998,0,the is the second acer computer i purchased in the last three months but i guess that means nothing to acer computer as well as amazon this will be the last big ticket item i buy from amazon

39,0.999999945,1,its nice that this model comes equipped with it gb ram keeps things moving i intel processor it would be nice if it were the i or i but this is not the latest model made by asus ac extremely fast wifi capabilities

17,0.414627861,0,the sticker on the back of the computer is just blackish grey
8,0.961990483,0,since both are google products theres no excuse for this
19,1,1,updated on dec although i am happy with the purchase of this computer i would like amazon to please note that i did not get the correct color
23,0.99999623,0,i did not get a chance to test unplugged gaming time but i would assume it would be around hour or less
38,0.999999997,1,i originally thought it would be neat to have a solid state drive for fast start times and touch screen cool factor in my work computer which does primarily excel work and coding
5,0.99999999,0,one month out of warranty and i now have a operating system damaged or missing message at startup
25,0.99656629,0,this asus unit is at the login screen after booting within seconds or less

25,0.987959508,0,they called within a week and said that the damaged was caused by the consumer not a flaw in the computer and they could fix it for unreal as we paid less that for the computer
39,0.999791041,1,while not an essential part of any laptop it would be nice if i could see the keys better at night
25,0.999999428,0,just after the warranty expired the display went out and it can not be repaired for less than the cost of the computer so in the trash it goes
9,0.999551253,0,one for system one for recovery one for the os programs and lastly a th for user data
6,0.999868563,0,its missing the sd card slot and there is a lot of damage to the structure itself
4,0.971254582,0,did not come with shrink wrap over the screen as my last one did and that one was listed as an amazon warehouse deal refurbished one
17,0.997146524,0,turned out it was this specific laptops onoff wireless switch that needed to be manually turned back on
23,0.993750506,0,and the customer support in china tell me it usually last hours depending on how you use it
15,0.989385896,0,what i received was last years model third generation in the same computer
32,0.959170022,0,less than a year and i have to take it in for the connection between the keyboard and the screen
25,0.964784856,0,hardware this thing is a fingerprint magnet both outside and inside
25,0.374704122,0,less than one year and i had to change the screen and battery
23,0.999999991,0,the battery life is the biggest failing since during regular use this laptop seems to last around two hours on battery
39,0.938086775,0,five stars for pricefeature value less some for the lack of keyboard indicator lights and optical drive opener problem
25,0.384640885,0,stated for hours i get less than hours
33,0.886159563,0,because it doesnt have a solid state drive in it windows ten does play nicer with it
25,0.965231555,0,then the problems started and asus tech support and warranty repair turned out to be a hollow shell
19,0.999998982,0,this way he if he doesnt need the weight or power of his macbook he can just use this out and about or for social media stuff while were watching tv
39,0.997031079,1,it would be nice to have the number pad but it would take up way too much space and would not be feasible on the air
32,0.96601376,0,less than days later the screen started having colored line across it
23,0.780735105,0,secondly i wanted something that would last some hours before needing to be recharged
0,0.992409371,0,likewise this apu with all of its integrated graphics capabilities feels like a big waste of silicon and transistors that cant be utilized when the tdp is limited to watts
17,0.999908103,0,ive used dell latitude laptops that always include a standard year warranty and they are solidly built and refuse to die except for the batteries that need replacing
23,0.99739948,0,advertising a hour battery life and delivering less than a third of that
17,0.999861337,0,but after a couple calls with technical support they took the computer back and are replacing it
25,0.99621297,0,we looked up warranty info and it appears its serviced outside the us
15,0.999362987,0,this is my th chromebook and nd from samsung that ive purchased in the last years
5,0.997705253,0,the readwrite is a lot faster and what that means for you is less twirling beach balls and speedier application launching and file saving
17,0.999972204,0,within that same hour i put it back in its box and i returned it and got my money back
28,0.999981335,0,the second biggest problem is the ssd solid state drive
25,0.999848399,0,once the laptop was sent in dell informed that the screen damage was customer induced and wants to charge canadian dollars a third of the cost of the laptop
0,0.979905709,0,when i bought it i did not realize that it was not windows based and i find it wont run any of the programs i use regularly
5,0.997158229,0,by day i started receiving a drive error message no less than times a day
23,0.999714256,0,the battery seems to last just under four hours
4,0.999251207,0,i purchased this laptop after watching lon seidmans review of this product and subsequent review of this product on here
23,0.992133858,0,if used continuously it can last for about five to six hours
15,0.762403806,0,i bought this computer when my last one stopped working
33,0.996224384,0,i like the tb and ram because i have thousands of photos and videos that i regularly take and access
39,0.999985225,1,i feel like the navy one looks like a macbook dupe overall super impressed and hopefully the battery lasts a long time i bought this for college needs
33,0.999999845,1,it would be so nice to have a way to access them without going through any workarounds but no google didnt support its own program on this otherwise delightful little netbook
15,0.998813692,0,the last one that i bought was another brand
23,0.119288145,0,also weights less than lbs
8,0.999999704,0,they work technically they work but its hit or miss in terms of does an app properly support tablet mode or is it a phone app stretched across the screen
2,0.999999992,0,sd cards inserted into the laptops card reader do not sit flush to the unit making carrying additional storage less convenient
37,0.999999999,0,if you want to save a bit of cash go with the regular non pro series and just lose mbps write speed and save
22,0.999999998,1,love the color its a transparency color hopefully it can support my essays
28,0.99710207,0,comparable to the njk accept this one has no cd drive and the cpu has less threads njk has this one has but this is also a lot thinner and lighter then the n
2,0.670797074,0,lastly theres no cddvd slot
7,0.987983019,0,the battery does seem to last about house and charges in a flash
23,0.990626365,0,the battery is also internal and must be replaced the same way
4,0.978755443,0,i would warn anyone purchasing any asus computers that they do not last
15,0.874243816,0,that computer is retired no faster than this asus and less than hours on a charge
39,0.445360948,0,with less than dollars i give stars to this hp model
0,0.65963559,0,thought it was a regular computer
30,0.961053087,0,bought this device used it for less than a week and now it wont power on
15,0.986873005,0,my last computer a dell lasted for years
10,0.99999876,1,it doesnt have all the bells whistles of other laptops on the market but for the price quality i hope this lasts for quite some time
39,0.991585545,1,it would be a great laptop if it worked or the company actually provided service
4,0.999999963,0,i purchased mine from walmart in my city for less than i could get it online but its worth the price i see it advertised on amazon or anywhere else
39,1,1,i wanted to run linux on it figured it would be no big deal but it uses a bit uefi boot loader on a bit cpu architecture which is ridiculous to try and change the operating system since there is virtually no linux distros that support it its also running a bit version of windows why have a bit cpu and put a bit os on it the only way to boot linux is to get ahold of a bit uefi boot loader put in the efiboot folder on your install medium then when it freezes on a command line while booting cd into the drivers
23,0.999999417,0,battery can last for several hours as advised but that number gets reduced if you use it on maximum performance mode of course
25,0.999028709,1,my only worry is that this freezing thing will get worse at the year mark but im trying my best to treat it well and hopefully this computer can last at least years
30,0.999990522,1,i purchased the extended year warranty for added piece of mind but hopefully i wont need to use it
17,0.999949592,0,never the less it could be but i have properly working laptop that has fallen apart from its monitor and can not be put back no matter what
8,0.999941304,0,i setup my chromebook to allow my family members to login as regular users
17,0.921355339,0,might be the last considering the support
17,0.999999494,0,they agreed to fix the computer but i would be without the computer for about weeks including ship time there and back and actual repair time
23,0.736134144,0,i hope that this laptop can last a couple of years
28,0.999999996,0,well according to wikipedia in computing a trim command allows an operating system to inform a solid state drive ssd which blocks of data are no longer considered in use and can be wiped internally
16,0.881625526,0,avg uses much less cpu when sitting idle
15,0.859706794,0,i am a mac person for the last years
15,0.992196134,0,im hoping this will last me years like my macbook did
16,0.998213734,0,with the lower portion of the ports sitting outside of the case
15,0.999933574,0,this is the second chromebook for my house and not the last my next computer will be another chromebook or a chromebox
9,0.999999977,0,a few things to note there is no optical drive youll need to use an external drive or download your software from the net
30,0.844797627,0,until last night id have given this computer stars
32,0.929318104,0,now less than years later the cover is coming apart
23,0.943396465,0,with gaming and designing i could barely last hours
17,0.981846134,0,a few days later i called asus sustomer support and filed a rma form
39,0.898616693,0,i had to buy an external drive though later on i had thought i would not need it but i do for the work i doing with it
28,0.996517284,0,in the last years ive gone through solid state drives
17,0.373137864,0,updated with this model a few years later and what
25,0.858812675,0,my problem is that the warranty shows starting in june and expiring in less than months
9,0.957139907,0,i installed it in less than a minute and required no dismantling of the laptop
17,0.999995627,0,probably rolling back the driver to the previous update or waiting for a fix by asus is the solution
31,0.999999711,0,also i found this machine on sale today at dell and frys for less than while at couple of online stores i note the price at over
5,0.999994121,0,i tried to back it up to a proper gb flash drive and the screen immediately started flashing on and off
23,0.964623692,0,theres a function in windows settings that lets you see what appsprocesses are draining the battery over the last hours
32,0.652764773,0,didnt even last hours before the screen went out
32,0.279647242,0,the screen is a victim of getting the price to where it is
8,0.513114631,0,for me im much less productive as a result
39,0.728959418,1,i wish the ac power adapter had prongs that stowed away for when carrying this in a bag
4,0.927303317,0,i would think that paying this price for a computer it would last longer than months
31,0.999090345,0,com and found windows pro oem for th of the regular price legit and verified but use paypal
15,0.999508296,0,i thought id be buying something that id have for a few years but less than a year in im having a lot of problems with it
23,0.999804607,0,maybe im the april fool to keep trying but number four about p m last night i unboxed number four
23,0.999981819,0,battery realistically will last hours with wifi and internet surfing instead of the hrs advertised
39,0.999274254,1,but it would be nice if the build quality would at hold up for a year
23,0.803022406,0,the chromebook will say it has hours left and a few minutes later it dies
15,0.999989646,0,i am done whp products nothing is designed to last beyond years and ive bought from the highest end to the cheaper
15,0.994043742,0,i been waiting to get one since last year
30,0.980195381,0,consi did have issues with wifi dropping about times but i updated the drivers and fingers crossed no issues for the last week
0,0.987809863,0,its a bit slower than my wifes regular computer but it gets the job done
9,0.999475185,0,hopefully the machine will last i do see that some people have issues crop up after a few months of use but type any computer manufactures followed by the words problems or issue and you will get billions of hits it comes with the program
39,0.999992252,1,yes it would be nice if the screen was higher resolution but for most of what i want to use it for and for the money this is a great deal
32,0.985970648,0,what i got was just a blue screen not on or off i shut it off and put it back on
15,0.999761064,0,how i came to buy this computer a few weeks ago i spilled water next to my macbook pro and fried the logic board
15,0.840860098,0,this is third computer from amazon and from hsn that i have purchased in the last few weeks
17,0.992730241,0,thank you amazon for taking it back im looking forward to another computer of another brand one which actually has customer service
8,1,0,i contacted google regarding the problems and after several attempts to get it going properly the google rep concluded the device needed to have the version of the google operating system updated

39,0.999994018,1,there is no way to configure the keyboards backlight outside of shutting it of turning it on or off there is no way to change the brightness level or set it to always on this is not a huge issue but it would be nice to be able to stop the keyboard backlight from shutting off after seconds of the last keystroke

30,0.997096587,0,its been plugged into the ac for days now but every time i unplug it the battery dies in less than seconds
39,0.931032211,1,it would be nice if the charging method was through micro usb like for phones or the option to use it as a charger
17,0.995127019,0,there are no authorized service centers outside of the factory so the computer needs to be shipped back to china for servicing

23,0.998381166,0,i would expect this notebook to last for to years but the battery probably will die before then
0,0.999522761,0,none the less the cons still feel like cons because carrying extra items makes the laptop mobility feel less mobile and therefore less convenient
28,0.999896272,0,this computer although it has less memory the solid state drive makes up the difference
0,0.999066357,0,it doesnt have the same beauty as a mac but at the price they are selling this one at i couldnt care less
27,1,0,it seems to change the date at about pm waking the computer from sleep to do so and usually does it multiple times if you keep putting the computer back to sleep otherwise it will just change it

15,0.998047536,0,my last hp lasted me years
15,0.995888044,0,however until the last month google had planned to support this model but had not yet gotten around to it
23,0.999218205,0,i might update the review later with pictures and an actual benchmark of battery life
0,0.999053088,0,they are not separate independent buttons like im used to and they are harder to press and make a louder click than my previous laptop dell vostro v
14,0.999969782,0,the previous c had standard sized slots but im guessing the thinness of the c necessitated the use of micro sized inputs
2,0.999826938,0,gtx strix graphics card came with faulty pre applied thermal paste and missing thermal pads from the gddrx memory modules
32,0.997897388,0,the keyboard is standard to pcs with blue back lighting which is helpful for night usage

23,0.986239184,0,the battery still runs on hours doing regular web surfing
19,0.99998662,0,i use mine for standard college student tasks but it can run some solid programs if needed
8,0.999999825,0,also the screen quality is horrendous but since it can be upgraded i can excuse this what i cant excuse is the scaling required to stop everything from appearing blurry
39,0.77505583,1,i think it would be a great computer if it worked
19,0.983148959,0,overall i would say this is a solid purchase for someone who has basic computer needs
24,1,1,right now i dont have a lot of confidence in it ever working i bought what i thought would be a new notebook but it seems to me after all the problems that we have had to endure that it is not new but abused
33,0.999999978,1,it would be great fro a year old but no one else that needs to work on anything for real
39,0.986582248,0,anyways i find that it makes the user experience considerably less transparent documentationinstructions on included hardwaresoftware is non existent with the laptop
6,0.99999998,0,and not too loaded with bloatware tho there were a lot of acer specific programs that didnt seem particularly useful
15,0.997294751,0,i transitioned from dell pcs last year to an imac and have not looked back since
4,0.982786765,0,the second reason is the hardware specs that are already listed above
23,0.968099316,0,hours lasts way longer than what i need and it will usually last me about days of school work
0,0.957474372,0,ive had a couple of macsmacbooks in the last years and heres my review of the inch mba ultra portable
32,0.999434839,0,once the computer was closed and reopened the screen would appear to be blank

32,0.999787524,0,i just received the computer back from repairs and it worked for about days and the same problem started happening again
32,0.962076563,0,so i went back to charging and had to reinstall a few programs
23,0.999650158,0,in power saving mode it can easily last hrs
17,0.958389879,0,defective product could not use had to send back big hassle
0,0.996749189,0,the double tap drag functionality is unreliable and requires precision on your part
8,0.999983689,0,i initially had a tablet with a wireless keyboard but it was an android device and wasnt compatible with a few programs i need for work
14,0.999999835,0,it has three regular usb ports so i can have my wireless mouse and keyboard hooked up a flash drive and a hdd with no problem
15,0.97080433,1,i made the mistake of not calibrating my colors properly hopefully you wont do the same
4,0.999776162,1,i bet theyd be helpful if i wanted those but i would be worried about what it would cost after a year i hope this unit lasts more than a year
28,0.996988134,0,its all soldered on and solid state and led backlit so it should last a lifetime
2,0.999999581,0,it also has a regular sd card slot so i can download pictures from my camera
15,0.990845807,0,fingers crossed that the automatic updates will solve these problems last point i want to critisize is that loads of programs are not compatible yet with chrome os
17,0.999989038,0,after about days worth of back and forth they told me that it is a hardware problem which is what i was saying from day one
12,1,1,but that would also cost me about with tax and it would be nice to have a more natural way to access the windows world rather then the unwieldy bootcamp option
33,0.532147847,1,all and all they are simple devices but it would be nice to have a more immediate access to deep config settings
30,0.836672312,0,within less than months the battery on this computer is not holding charge
9,0.901999531,0,some one with less patience would have re installed the o s and started over
0,0.979819543,0,but i have owned a lot of computers over the last twenty years and i make a living working with computers and i have never seen this happen anywhere before
14,1,1,i wish the screen hinge had more range of motion and it needs a keyboard lightbacklight other than that and the fact that win blows works perfectly
17,0.994559035,0,i didnt know this till i jarred my laptop when i went to turn it on the drive was missing
9,0.443377728,0,there are some differences from a regular computer but nothing that is an issue for me
0,0.999884724,0,if you plan on using it to produce the few things that it can produce like type an essay then this can be useful without an internet connection
17,0.999965313,0,secondly i went to their customer support web site and downloaded the operations manual for my specific machine
15,0.750391778,0,i have used lenovo computers for the last several years was a big fan
32,0.862027144,0,overall this laptop is going to last you a year before its practically unusable

15,0.879680286,0,this did not last year
8,0.999999935,0,chrome os offers the easiest maintenance model of desktop operating systems setting up upgrading protecting back uping or updating require much less time and skill
33,0.999570199,0,with a netbook or regular laptop you can still do work you can access your harddrive and you dont have to rely on the cloud which is now inaccessible under circumstances like i mentioned
39,0.934741572,1,it would be nice if they included a to drive bay adapter
15,0.997653908,0,i bought this one as a replacement november so less than a year ago
6,0.999784945,0,turns out the wifi card was either missing or not properly installed
0,0.999981588,0,every attempt i made to use the pen that come with system was stymied by less than functional sw as i couldnt find a way to covert writing to text which is all i would use it for so losing the touch scree isnt that big a deal
15,0.982036964,0,i bought it cyber monday of last year
17,0.999978478,0,but the laptop burned months later to request a warranty repairs hp asked me to send the laptop back to united states they refuse to repair this computer outside us

17,0.886303553,0,it arrived via amazon delivery after less than hours
23,0.998442631,0,as already mentioned the battery is rated to last almost hours
16,0.992843394,0,you can see this if you drag a window across the screen or scroll text
14,0.999999765,0,in addition it has been years since i last connected a laptop to the internet via a gigabit ethernet port so that connection will not be missed
4,0.932655915,0,but then they did the same thing on the next product sold
0,0.995989589,0,i like the feel of this computer hope this will last me through the rest of my days age becomes an issue
23,0.891526422,0,i installed this last night
31,0.934960669,0,the same price listed is and the regular is around so idk whats up with that i got it for less than

16,0.999857248,0,however when viewing pages with white backgrounds you will notice a slightly cloudy appearance to the display
16,0.304620135,0,the windows homepage does not display and neither does the regular screen
32,0.896280177,0,setup took less than three minutes all systems go
8,0.99972801,0,a few of the inbuilt office style apps e g mail seem like relics from the mid s
17,0.999999994,0,i also called amazon technical support and was told to delete my anti virus protection and if in days it continues i should send it back for a replacement or refund

4,0.99995593,0,but overall it gets the job done and for the price i paid this was well worth it
4,0.999802183,0,i upgraded ram to gb and got this beast for less than us
5,0.83352448,0,restarting brought me immediately back to the same error screen

31,0.999999997,0,i bought the asus chromebook flip to use as a lightweight laptop for regular web browsing so i wouldnt have to lug out my macbook pro
39,0.994485994,1,it is far more versatile than i thought it would be and i admit i have a lot to learn about it but it boots fast the screen is very nice indeed and the sound is excellent
6,0.99999493,1,it would be a waste of money to keep i would rather have none than waste money
23,0.866238899,0,one problem the battery dies in less than an hour
9,0.819276013,0,now i cant imagine why i carried around the beast that was my last computer
14,0.999999888,0,i bought the ideapad s because it was selling for less than two hundred dollars on amazon and because it had an hdmi port so i could play movies from the ideapad on my big screen hd tv
23,0.719079139,0,if they refresh the system this will be the third and last time that i reconfigure this machine
28,0.999999989,0,and of course the solid state drive means no internal moving parts except for the fan which is barely audible
31,0.999763214,0,it has all the spec items i was looking for and it cost about less than i was expecting to pay
0,0.489285647,0,i am a mac user for the last years

4,0.99999993,0,i believe this is the price performance king the i offers about a performance gain but the extra cost coupled with having to get a k touch screen save the money touch on a laptop is a gimmick cost you about battery life means its not worth the extra money
23,0.953665196,0,this problem has been happening about every minutes for the last four hours
7,0.982775099,0,battery doesnt hold a charge i have had the computer for less than months

4,0.999991665,0,for the price i paid even with upgrading the ram to gb i still payed much less than comparable laptops
9,0.999897456,0,also the computer came with a few apps already installed that were a waste of space like candy crush
39,0.999967157,0,it doesnt help that there are a few hurdles to jump with the operating system and the missing peripherals that should have been included for the price throw all this into a pot and you end up with stars
0,0.955486212,0,lastly i seem to hear some type of noise in the laptop as well
39,0.999999999,1,at this rate the drive will easily last another years hopefully by then we will have something a little better but most likely ill end up upgrading to something else far sooner

25,0.99964757,0,notes when i initially ordered this product i received a faulty product that had an unresponsive and physically damaged space bar and was missing a power cable
17,0.999848599,0,i rolled back to a previous windows state and updated the drivers manually to fix the problem
30,0.999961368,0,this acer replaces a dell i bought last year that keeps dropping wireless internet connection

23,0.999836705,0,i just hope the internal battery can be changed in the future when it stops holding charge
17,0.999605152,0,i tried to fix it for a few hours before i gave up and just restored from factory default settings which took several hours

39,0.999970538,1,it does have a slot for a memory card to expand the memory but just seems like it would be easier to have another to gigs from the factory
30,0.921304313,0,i ended up missing the touch screen with windows so i bought this dell
31,0.999962961,0,note i bought the macbook air model for tax in may so i am not comparing the uxfa usm to the regular price macbook

39,1,1,generally the speakers arent very high quality but headphone jack is fine if it had an sd card slot for expandable memory if the hard disk was larger than gigs to store more downloaded movies a setting to change text size of everything would be nice hard to use the device lying down as the text is a bit small when my eyes are feet away as they generally are when i try to use a laptop lying down
39,0.543606233,1,it would be nice if the documentation pointed that out
39,0.890871922,0,i never even had the chance to use it away from my desk or outside of my apartment

17,0.99793692,0,i manually turned it off and on several times over the course of half an hour to no avail
33,0.994640009,0,one of the last things i can try and do now is to disable indexing but that would remove the search feature from the computer
16,0.999695441,0,have used it for several hours and at four and a half hours battery does not show much charge left
0,0.400895686,0,strangely colored bars would sometimes cross the screen
39,0.983192857,0,i wanted a screen so opted for a bit less memory etc
23,0.999979856,0,then last month it just refuse to turn on battery if fully charge so i could not figure out the problem
0,0.981010538,0,its fun and it can be useful in a couple of circumstances but i would have preferred a cheaper computer with a regular screen

0,0.999863208,1,if you are looking for something more portable i would suggest the acer r or the acer chromebook but if you are in the market for a larger model with an amazing screen this does the job

25,0.993394888,0,this is not a refurbished product there is no excuse

0,0.742574233,0,it was no a surprise at all to get hours of regular use from it so lightweight
32,0.999445737,0,i ordered one and less then a week later the screen went white
33,0.999996409,1,i chose this over the equivalently priced asus chromebook because i thought it would be nice to run the full office suite on it for work but ended up returning it after less than a day of use

35,1,1,so after some debating i made the decision to go with the cb not knowing if it would be as good as the c but reading it was fan less and a tad lighter gave me greater interest and while there are some negative reviews on the baytrail vs the haswell cpu with regards to performance i really never push it to the extent of these benchmark tests and rarely have more than tabs open

23,0.99917339,0,lastly wait until the unit is around battery left to charge
23,0.478698841,0,so i hope it will last for a few years
39,1,1,in the past when flying all day and waiting for connecting flights i would take a power bank with me so having the extra juice in the notebook is much more preferable to me than having to remember to bring one more thing and juggling the items when having to use the power bank when needed the processor speed is up from to ghz as it has the latest th generation intel core i u there is supposed to be an option to get this model with the better seventh generation of core i processor aka intel kaby lake w gb of ram wa tb drive but then again i read that it was supposed to be released to so take that with a grain of salt speakers are stellar imo crisp clear not tinny at all i tend to use earbuds most of the time but they have sufficient volume to listen to easily without earbuds they have the latest usb type c w full size hdmi headset jack sizes the webcam is as advertised good in low light no complaints there the graphics card an integrated intel hd is good for watching movies but it is not meant for gaming nor does it excel in that area so my sons are not drooling over this which for me is a good thing the ram is gb sufficient but would have liked to add more if there was an option as i said before i dont know if there are any options to configure this w other features because as of now i ca nt get any info from hp the price is down from the last entry level envy but i would have rather had the price stay the same or even increase w more upgrades included the issues that i have that are still very disconcerting are these the hinges whether or not they have been improved remains to be seen along with the downgraded screen resolution and no driverssoftware downloads available at this point in their proposed release date which has already passed not being able to wipe the system to remove the bloatware or have any tech support thus the stars
28,0.99533317,0,ssd require less power produce less heat and weigh less than hdd
23,0.985307786,0,the battery lasts me all day with regular use no problem

23,0.964434244,0,this computers battery life is less than minutes
33,0.999984722,0,since it is a chromebook if it is lost or damaged i can buy another chromebook and have all my settings and apps back in about half an hour using mcds wifi
39,1,1,i wish the screen was brighter like an ipad but i guess im so used to the sharp perfect brightness of apple products that this seems a little less bright than i would like but oh well still a good purchase since i wouldnt want to spend as much on a macbook
38,0.925692156,0,overall it just feels and looks like your solid quality american made product
23,0.570039227,0,the battery life is less than of what apple advertises
32,0.588464508,0,windows boot from the bios to logon screen less than seconds
15,0.984507915,0,i paid less that when i purchased this a year ago
38,0.999999982,0,from the outside it remains the same but inside the macbook pro with retina display feels like its way ahead of last years model
15,0.424100055,0,my last laptop was a dell with a screen
7,0.971482832,0,it allowed us to give her a computer without breaking the bank and with less worry about it breaking
8,0.322313801,0,it was a regular computer not a touchsreen
39,0.999990841,1,my only gripe if i had to have one is that i wish the screen was a little bit bigger but i am very happy with this thing
15,0.810131934,0,i have owned dozens of computers over the last years
32,0.83936824,0,after less than hours of work on this computer it quit functioning wont boot
32,0.616979565,0,im not a big fan of how all the outlets are on the back on the computer either
4,0.999264495,0,my suggestion its worth it for the extra ram to keep it useful longer
15,0.952388833,0,i purchased this last year in june for my granddaughters birthday
16,0.968488441,0,my initial observations are that yes there are a few quirks with the power
23,0.971712975,0,meanwhile my battery charged less and less
23,0.99867148,0,the battery was supposed to last hours every time i used it it holds charge for hour and minutes
23,0.996848791,0,dont expect battery time to last the hours they tell you
23,0.92401799,0,battery used to last hours now lasts
15,0.999193425,0,maybe things have changed since my last acer machine a few years back and im just being overly paranoidcautious but im really hoping to keep this one around for a while
19,0.412400646,0,im a computer consultant and regularly purchase computers for my clients
25,0.965873734,0,last week after the warranty was expired the thing actually caught fire
32,0.486067681,0,the last one screen lasts minutes
23,0.999984668,0,the ips screen is a delight although the maximum brightness setting may be less than you were expecting even though it is quite usable
17,0.892361738,0,after less than hours of use it is being sent back
17,0.999997224,0,tried to send it back to dell with no expectation of a refund and customer care actually told me to look up the address on line
23,0.96773494,0,i would buy this again but i think these will last four or five years
32,0.999763511,0,i did have some initial problem with the i got blue screen messages a few times and the laptop did not seem to be charging properly
25,0.639218164,0,i bought this computer in dec it stopped working less than a month later
32,0.956096123,0,i have been using this computer for a few weeks and several keys have stopped working
16,0.850285879,0,we also have lots of units that the battery ceases to function if left in sleep for longer than a few days
10,1,1,so when i saw this i thought it would be perfect to take places and to have with me when im just browsing the web on the couch or in bed
32,0.701785249,0,however two months after purchase last august the screen started flashing on and off
25,0.999999975,0,a few weeks ago the bottom left hinge broke while i was still under warranty and acer said that i would have to pay dollars to get it repaired
32,0.951864695,0,a few days later i received the zenbook there was a display issue
0,0.765686473,0,its the last menu item
6,0.998995031,0,very few pre installed bloatware means less time you have to waste cleaning it
34,0.999999997,1,i would love if device manufacturers would just be honest about their battery life estimates hopefully someone finds this information helpful
0,0.999443618,0,i couldnt drag and drop items in it but after i changed the behavior in settings everything went well from there
15,0.999956341,0,i bought one of these chromebooks for my husband last year
39,0.999041578,1,if i had one complaint it would be the small ssd hard drive at just over gigs but i cant even be mad as i frequently experience boot up times of less than seconds and the laptop is able to have a second hard drive installed for more storage
4,0.949161587,0,i have not used a chromebook with less than gb of ram but i would not recommend any less
39,0.831731264,1,i wish this model had stars from all people
15,0.888078017,0,it happened on and off like that for the next week being anywhere from a few hours to a few months off
25,0.993408364,0,i was outside my year warranty
30,0.99321253,0,purchased this laptop less than a year ago and it is barely if at all working anymore
0,0.999999919,0,the touch pad is also a bit less responsive than the ones i am used to so sometimes i have to try several times to click on or drag an item
9,0.842149538,0,i expect the usb c ecosystem to expand rapidly in the next few months
33,0.998486968,0,the nvidia g whatever chip i could care less about in this computer
27,0.999659664,0,i installed one on mine but found that i never switched over to it and so uninstalled it subsequently
36,1,1,the only reason i knocked it down start because it would be nice to have a quad core processor instead of the dual core and usb ports instead of usb and usb but you cant beat this little chromebook sized unit at
17,0.794882804,0,out of the box the computer feels lopsided and hollow
25,0.974327631,0,update had it repaired under warranty and now a few months later it wont boot up
32,0.999231692,0,went to sign in and put my programs on it and it kept coming up drivers missing or not updated
39,0.990958,1,the screen isn t the best for this price i would like to see ips
15,0.734971538,0,all for less than over years ago
23,0.999991351,0,and dont believe the hour battery bs mine will last about hours between charging
17,0.999999996,0,this will be my last post lenovo will no longer respond to me and im supposing im out all the money i spent on this p o s i had opportunity to e mail some v p of the company and never heard back and now all i get is auto replies saying hold for parts ive decided to go to court and get my money back from somebody i was had and thats all there is to it
16,0.999907729,0,now it is at the point that the back of the case is pulling away from the display screen every time it is opened and closed
15,0.880920063,0,he had a computer that was on its last leg
23,0.933423747,0,i have gotten the battery to last over hours
17,0.984742897,0,tried to insatall windows pro and pro none of them successed missing drivers and could not start after few ms updates
39,0.941852587,0,battery lasts longer and consume less power since this model is not a touch screen model
15,0.999998707,0,one last thing just for the heck of it i did another search on google this time i replaced the name acer with dell you guessed it page after page of links to forums will a host of issues
15,0.867684428,0,however this happened all about this time last year
23,0.962169673,0,the battery also dosent last
5,0.999997008,1,i think the add on works fine and hopefully will eliminate another screen replacement whether on warranty or not
4,0.999999599,0,sign up for the amazon prime thing and you can get this macbook delivered next day for less than the list price
33,0.999972934,1,it would be nice it the in asus transformer book was able to take photos then it really would be a complete recording tool
8,0.999999993,0,i did go back and upgrade the device to windows professional so i could add the media center components that microsoft decided to split out from the basic system
27,0.982877846,0,im not into social networking and purchased the incorrect item
15,0.986786195,0,just bought this less than a year and it already isnt working
17,0.993016321,0,inside and outside this dell was defective and dell has lost a longtime customer and a future customer
0,0.999297783,0,lastly the i processor seals the deal taking on everything ive thrown at it without breaking a sweat
0,0.934047572,0,battery will be a pain to change out if need as back is solid
9,0.979948265,0,the lack of an optical drive in a laptop becomes less and less of an issue now
32,0.57916504,0,it stopped working with less than a year use
8,0.999999998,0,basically its just made to support google everything found on a chrome book can be found on any regular computer with a google chrome browser
17,0.981257159,0,i can not give this laptop that last start for the following reasons there is not option in north america that i can find to get one without the touchscreen
9,0.999979969,1,setup was a snap and dont miss not having an optical drive hopefully this cut down the weight
17,0.896614304,0,i will check back for future models
39,0.979217998,1,it just would be great if asus can fix mentioned problems and make this great laptop even grater
17,0.819779614,1,a new computer should be able to function smoothly
17,0.806448611,0,i couldnt stand to even touch the outside case of the computer
17,0.847141259,0,so i am left with a junk computer that i got less than two months of use out of it
5,0.998548409,0,i had several blue screens of death yes and all the drama that comes with it in the middle of a windows installation
17,0.999318517,0,ive had this for one year it has never worked properly and just got it back from the it repair warrantee place
25,0.987734801,0,and with a third party app you can do the last
19,0.999999996,0,i can think up half a dozen features to improve it that would double or triple the price but for writing reading web browsing and email on the go this cant be beat
17,0.873438388,0,i ordered a replacement one from a outside source for
9,0.938023978,0,lastly for those that need it the y processor supports both vt x and vt d virtualization instruction sets
15,0.984213394,0,i think it is not unreasonable to expect a laptop to last years this one did not even make it halfway
23,0.90459037,0,i wanted to wait several months before i left a review to ensure the product would last
25,0.883378306,0,i sent the machine back twice within the warranty period and both times issues continued a few months later
14,0.999999947,0,i was between the dell xps and the asus zenbook ux but this one takes the cake because it had a regular sized hdmi port and usb c
17,0.945863798,0,at last i got it to do a system image restore
2,0.983694922,0,i moved the regular to a storage drive for music and movie
23,0.999994731,0,the battery life lasts about hours on maximum screen brightness doing regular tasks
8,0.999801771,0,i kept telling them there was some sort of flag killing the program on a regular basis
14,0.999999704,0,on the left side starting from the rear is the ac port and beside that an rj ethernet jack
16,1,1,the only real issue this thing has is that it requires a cable between the display and the keyboard to charge them both at the same time this would be a small issue but they put the connectors on opposite sides of the tablet and keyboard so it means you have to have the cable running across the back of the tablet when you are charging both units
4,0.998936166,0,overall this laptop is a beast and totally worth the price
17,0.988231766,0,when he was finished he had dropped my computer replaced it and had it not work and i later discovered scratches on the casing along with three missing screws
19,0.999998445,0,its your basic laptop with all the specs needed to search the net or go on social media or type anything
32,0.979207259,0,the screen regularly goes blank
17,0.999989918,0,i look at events and see that on the last day they had my laptop before they sent it back to me someone had cleared the driver to let windows re install it it re installed and still didnt work
36,1,1,the only reason i knocked it down start because it would be nice to have a quad core processor instead of the dual core and usb ports instead of usb and usb but you cant beat this little chromebook sized unit at
15,0.947552481,0,the computer crashed completely in less than a year
0,0.998426841,0,it is split into two parts which connects to the bottom of the screen and if you just push it in like a regular laptop the case will break
32,0.602364824,0,additionally the laptop has no issue running multiple programs at the same time
28,0.990650578,0,but there is one problem and this means less star for this review cpu temperatures
15,0.990325102,0,i bought this computer less than a year ago
32,0.998752408,0,over the last year ive had continual keyboard problems ive had to reinstall the audio driver times
30,0.999578337,0,i tried several times uninstalling the battery and starting over but ended up with the same result
25,0.99994489,0,the lcd broke but they replaced it under the warranty last month and sent it back to us replaced without problem
23,1,0,it looks like this charge will last around four hours which included some gaming and video watching so i expect it may go up during lighter use and with battery conservation in mind
32,0.626778238,0,screen no longer works and its been less than two years
16,0.996724405,0,the windows icon in the lower left half of the screen no longer functioned
33,0.999707853,0,seamless downloads and installation of programs and google chrome is a solid cross platform browser
39,0.999621847,1,since ill be his help desk whenever something comes up i figured it would be good to have an identical laptop to what i ordered for him
31,0.999999787,0,i received my chrome book today and have spent the last few hours playing around with this
19,0.530622906,0,half sizing these keys makes them a lot harder to use
0,0.999967765,0,the touch screen is sometimes less responsive in tablet mode compared to the same actions made in laptop mode
5,0.939504877,0,dll files missing or corrupted blue screens of death mentioning ntfs
16,0.99568114,0,i can leave it on for about hours powered on and the battery will drain about or less
10,0.997684278,1,i do really love this computer i hope this doesnt happen again
17,0.999973067,0,i come back its in a blue screen that said it was in automatic repair it gave me the option to restart to see if that would solve the issue it didnt
17,0.9967027,0,i will next try the last remaining support option
33,0.999999563,1,it would be great to drop it on zombies during apocalypse or make running with it in your backpack an olympic event or cruel and unusual torture but mobile and laptop predator is not backpack it doesnt fit
8,0.995801218,0,regular usage it stick in mid s
0,0.88185982,0,it is the crappiest computer ive ever seen much less owned
9,0.987176115,0,it is missing bluetooth and an optical drive
14,0.999996912,0,it last for almost a week and that is hardcore use and it comes with all the usb connectors and a mini usb to usb cable as well
23,0.525017771,0,can downgrade to windows if needed one of the few models left that can do this
4,0.993360926,0,overall solid deal at this price
15,0.983344653,0,we have a asus fla purchased last year
39,0.557886836,0,some games from the last year even play at that frame rate on ultra settings
0,0.992475486,0,its lightweight and the keyboard sounds a bit hollow as one types
27,0.999993603,0,i purchased this item from a local big box because of a promotion they were running
33,0.999999978,1,it would be great fro a year old but no one else that needs to work on anything for real
32,0.999164778,0,at less than a month old the screen started to blank out
5,0.186090665,0,not missing the ports
23,0.999995081,0,update last night while i was trying to fall asleep the power brick started making a squealing noise so i unplugged it
17,0.999817021,0,i spent hours on the phone with microsoft trying to troubleshoot a solution with no success
32,0.67958377,0,i had my last chromebook years with multiple drops and slides and clunks and it took them in stride
39,0.993937035,0,charger port is missing the plastic that should be on the bottom cover
15,0.98211503,0,this will be my last razer product and i thoroughly regret my purchase
10,1,1,screen graphicsas the title with retina display would suggest the screen graphics are quite noteworthy
39,0.998231296,0,for less i could get the specs i wanted minus the in feature and a screen that lets me draw
23,0.996090958,0,the battery on it seems to last about to hours
8,0.999168954,0,the operating system is windows pro which has expanded productivity features than regular version
32,0.930021553,0,but the above issues are causing me one year later to find a replacement
19,1,1,updated on dec although i am happy with the purchase of this computer i would like amazon to please note that i did not get the correct color
17,0.870989274,0,worked for less than one month and now i have been working with dell for months without any resolution
23,0.999992264,0,i can charge this laptop for a few hours and with that the battery will last all day at school
32,0.998559552,0,it was my daily driver for almost half a year
23,0.931603007,0,the battery last for a couple days
30,0.999858753,0,but now less than two years after buying it the battery no longer charges its stuck at and will not run if not plugged in
19,1,0,i am rather basic computer user basic word processing spreadsheet digital photo processing and of course email etc
16,0.998670181,0,later when i went to install an ssd i found that the frame of the laptop had actually been bent out of shape
25,0.999938279,0,people are giving it one star does come with a manufactures year warranty so what is the big deal send it back
10,1,1,this computer hopefully now that jobs is gone who knows what the quality is really like my iphone has been a disappointment recently will hopefully last me another years
22,0.999999998,1,love the color its a transparency color hopefully it can support my essays
7,0.999999997,0,froze on setup had to jump through several hoops including reinstalling the os by flash drive to manage to get it to actually set up properly
39,0.999999633,1,it would be great to take to class as it is relatively light for a large screen laptop and being relatively inexpensive less of a trauma were it lost or stolen than if it cost three times as much
30,0.999930901,0,n b neither shutting off nor starting up did i touch the back of the machine so i dont know how the battery became unlatched
7,0.80740744,0,this was the saddest excuse laptop ive ever encountered
25,0.999999998,1,however days in i find out samsung chromebook touch screens are failure prone didnt expect that from samsung so hopefully the power of amazon can either get a replacemnet refurbished or new one or at least repair it somehow
12,0.999999979,0,initially i thought it was just the os and drivers that were causing the track pad to not register the physical clicks so i updated all of the drivers and reinstalled windows
8,0.999702765,0,can print through regular printer on your network as well as wireless printers
0,0.980938684,0,ive used this computer less than times and havent downloaded anything on it
15,0.97080433,1,i made the mistake of not calibrating my colors properly hopefully you wont do the same
15,0.958714055,0,ive had the advertised laptop for less than year
33,0.999902437,0,it lacks apples support network and resale value but if it dies in a year you can buy another one and still have spent less than the mac costs
31,0.993606851,0,as others have stated or hours is about what you get with regular browsing not hours
19,0.999991172,0,im a computer programming student and was looking for a laptop i could use regularly to take to class and double as a desktop at home
32,0.99999798,0,my hp envy died out exactly months from purchase screen went blank in the middle of running and computer will not turn back on
9,0.999999909,1,it would be great if an additional ram slot could be given with it as it only has one and comes with gb of ram which is very less for u will have to purchase additional ram gb to get a good speed with the software and os a big negative for this laptop
25,0.999999078,1,when i stated that it would be better to return the item and get a cheaper one if it didnt have a year warranty
16,0.999326749,0,i have to resize and drag them all back into place every time i wake it up
0,0.896702067,0,if you actually want to do anything later though youll have to buy another computer
39,0.99952624,1,i can change the volume by using the settings charm as well but it would be great if there were a volume button or else another fn key on the right somewhere
38,0.923158081,0,it weights less and is thinner than the macbook air and its design is so asthetically pleasing
17,0.99782398,0,laptop arrived without battery and this model has it inside the fixed enclosure so sending it back in less than hours of arrival
39,0.997177061,0,that means that the biggest microsd card that i could find that would work in this machine is gb or less
32,0.874030472,0,it need two factory reset in less than one year
15,0.973672336,0,less than months since purchased and the computer turns off as soon as it is unplugged
25,0.827230923,0,the display itself is actually a portrait x rather than x yet at the same time the acer logos on both the front and back are oriented in landscape
16,0.999999763,0,another thing to notice is that her laptop came with white painting stains the battery was already inside instead of being properly packed but this is the sellers fault
7,0.967708033,0,ive had this laptop for less than four months and am now running into hardware problems
32,0.999992005,0,after the last reset the keyboardmouse and touchscreen would not respond to user input when windows loaded up although in the bios it worked
1,0.187647857,0,graphics it has a gtx in it for less than
15,0.982721022,0,it will last through one session of using my laptop without plugging it in maybe hours
15,0.998111501,0,but performs well for price no issues at present have been using for last month
7,0.995407265,0,what happens is when you select your customization from the setup you get to the very last step and then the computer errors out and reboots
33,0.999986597,0,it wont connect to public wifi it wont continue on my home wifi this happened this year i think
4,0.999931287,0,lastly i dont intend to upgrade neither the hd nor the ram however if u do lots of reviews say it cant be done on this model of asus zenbook
9,0.821476247,0,after installing additional gb memory and ssd laptop boots up in less than seconds from power off
39,0.999915933,1,it would be nice if the software could store appsdownloaded content on the sd card but maybe that will come down the road in chrome os
2,1,0,add a usb external drive or usb stick and i have local storage though the chromebook comes with years of google drive storage
15,0.935595218,0,we have had this product for less than one year months acutually
19,0.954845983,0,it would not let me or anyone log on less than years after purchase
8,0.999994877,0,as for the operating system ive grown accustomed to it after a few months and i have no reason to go back to windows mac os or a desktop linux os
39,1,1,dont listen to any reviews saying slow or lack of memory this s is so easily upgradable and a great price added a gb m ssd if you take the time and read the manual you can see the endless possibilities and you get windows on top it would be foolish not to buy this the upgrades are plug and play i going to trade my wifes stream in to buy her one of these back boys she will only need a gb m making it a bargain i burnt out my lenovo v it was a beast i started doing some recent and came to this logical choice was weary of netbooks and even online electronic sales because of the returns but it would have cost more to remake the v very satisfied and the new s is going on a couple months old now still satisfiedthankspjc
25,0.963202811,0,stopped working less than a month after support expired
3,0.99813653,0,it is supposed to be the fastest standard on the market nvme not the standard of a few years back
17,0.989765628,0,well turn on turbo in magician software and all others drives are left at less then half the speeds in any area
25,0.983246137,0,the seller stated on the amazon as the battery last up to hours
17,0.997774324,0,i later found out that my laptop had decided the processor was actually the proper gpu
30,0.999998927,0,the laptop updated itself to the point where there wasnt space on the laptop anymore in less than a year
23,0.999978341,0,the battery life is less than an hour unplugged on brightness

15,1,0,i bought my hp laptop in my last year at college three years ago now and we all know that laptops arent built to last a lifetime
15,0.998688892,0,is a lot to spend for a chrome book that didnt even last a year
4,0.999983779,0,if this had gb of ram instead and the touchscreenqhd was replaced with regular p and it was sold for i would soooo buy this
2,1,0,i bought a gb sd card to go with this to have for external storage but i havent even begun to fill the internal drive so im not worried
4,0.999682657,0,overall at the price that i purchased the price it is well worth it
12,1,1,but that would also cost me about with tax and it would be nice to have a more natural way to access the windows world rather then the unwieldy bootcamp option
23,0.999831442,0,my last laptop couldnt even last four hours without having to be charged up
15,0.999999846,0,i have a desktop gaming rig id built a couple years back and it was starting to show its age so i decided my next computer was going to one i could sit on the couch to play
14,0.999997846,1,i use a usb wireless mouse anyway but it would be nice if the mouse was nicer
25,0.989314207,0,after about months outside the year warranty the computer started dying between battery
8,0.999890885,0,the cds i received with windows basically killed the computer and it took a professional to reinstall everything
15,0.558846241,0,i have had this computer for less than six weeks
16,0.999995555,0,i would have to physically take apart the bottom of the computer and remove the battery cable put it back and assemble the bottom and the computer would turn back on
30,0.999720699,0,after notifying dell that i had just purchased this laptop last aug they said that their warranty started as soon as the retailer purchased the laptop in this case
39,1,1,so far have not had a issue it runs just as good as my asus gaming laptop now only down side would be the screen is a bit weird of a color you can fix it by messing with the display settings to get it less green also i did have to switch settings to use the nvidia processor in the nvidia control panel once i did so runs even better
17,0.997658539,0,ive been in contact with the apple customer support team for the last months or so
10,0.997684278,1,i do really love this computer i hope this doesnt happen again
1,0.998784398,0,compared with kodi the vlc player is much less processor intensive both with mp and mkv files
23,0.997385707,0,in around an hour or less so i dont mind no triple screen does not work and i was not expecting it to work
23,0.561520408,0,it will not last up to hours like said on description
4,0.999889986,0,overall i think this thing is definitely worth the price
4,0.921054028,0,no windows laptop offers comparable specs at the same price
15,0.997544784,0,this will be my last dell purchase in my lifetime
23,0.96220038,0,battery works about hours of regular web surfing gaming is less about hours with the fans
32,0.966120488,0,after having this computer for a week i was about to rate it stars but things have improved in the last few days
20,1,1,since people generally give reviews right after they receive a product i think it would be great to give people an idea of how a product is running a month and a half into ownershipthe first thing i would like to mention is lag time
4,0.981530506,0,going for a tb ssd next same brand
3,1,0,i initially checked out some chrome books but those devices are basically toys gui interface almost exclusively celeron cpu and gb ram were big turn offs for me
23,0.995016998,0,battery life is realistically less than hours with highest brightness
17,0.999999965,1,i tried to contact customer support and they basically told me that it was a motherboard failure something that would be very expensive to fix that practically crippled my system that it wasnt their fault and i was on my own i have never owned a system that becomes practically crippled in a year
32,0.904941981,0,it shipped to my apartment in less than two business weeks the day before we left which is why i even gave it a two star
25,0.986406795,0,had to send it back after owning it for less than a year
0,0.891097893,0,they are now selling the laptop for less and will also not honor the price drop
0,0.999938459,0,i read in a previous review where this item was compared to a ford f ive owned several f s and have found them to be reliable efficient workhorses that got the work done
15,0.999742549,0,i bought this netbook in september of last year
15,0.995019403,0,ive sworn by hp for years but this will be my last purchase

15,0.865904919,0,not the hp i bought a few years back
15,0.961981216,0,i did purchase it at wal mart it lasted less then a year
19,0.997349392,0,last ssds have dropped in price quite a bit so i cant imagine why that wasnt standard
0,0.999731739,0,it has its limitations but once you adapt to them and see instead the benefits of this machine you will probably never want to go back to a regular computer
0,0.684775783,0,this last part doesnt factor into my review
15,0.997167284,0,one last note i tried connecting a classroom projector to my chromebook in order to show a powerpoint presentation all to no avail
23,0.798534238,0,i like this laptop but just wished the battery would last longer
39,0.853409728,0,i havent installed chrome yet but it will hopefully take up less system resources
32,0.999963771,0,so for example if you are looking at a blank white pagescreen it wont be clearly all white the screen will have multi colored blurs as if your screen is smearedgreasy
30,0.927198566,0,however upon finding out that my university offered computer labs specifically for architects my needs for a laptop became less strenuous
39,0.99328406,1,the one i received has dead line on the screen shows blue it would be otherwise a nice laptop for the price
15,0.985099248,0,this is the last time i trust an acer product
30,0.822292946,0,just wish the battery would last longer
15,0.990706436,0,i bought this product last year and didnt use it
1,0.957084975,0,theres no moving parts including the absence of a fan so its virtually silent
6,0.999681704,0,as i have volunteered for a local senior center teaching computers i would say i have the ability to teach
15,0.991127524,0,next thing you know my computer died last week and would not charge at all
4,0.951556084,0,if this model was less i would recommend it to anyone
15,0.982835016,0,i have used a dell at my office the last years i soley trust this brand

15,0.992084704,0,my wife home schools our kids and has been using google docs for the last couple of years to keep spreadsheets on progress and scores
37,0.999488309,0,excuse the typos i typed all this on my iphone via diabetic index finger
0,0.993991073,0,i do plan to carry it occasionally to some events but not daily so the weight is not a problem for me
17,0.997236185,0,i already sent my computer back once to have the jack replaced and now the second ones breaking down
0,0.697219888,0,i havent touched my regular office computer since i got this
5,0.740721994,0,it may be missing the windows program
15,0.827413719,0,however the item is less by at dell
17,0.997002461,0,they did offer to charge me to fix a battery that showed or less wear on a diagnostic and that should be working
9,0.94888639,0,i installed windows to this drive last wednesday and today while i was closing battlefield my computer shut off
23,0.27790389,0,lastly its interconnectivity
15,0.999867043,0,last lenovo product i will ever purchase
15,0.904278589,0,do you want to know why all of the computer magazines rated this as the ssd for the last few months
17,0.623337797,0,i already set the computer back to factory settings several times and still having the same issues
23,0.954807605,0,makes me wonder if the battery will last
3,0.999998031,0,if cpu intensive tasks are a thing you do regularly you should be looking at intel i laptops not any of these chromebooks
25,0.995142968,0,then just a few nights ago i bent the screen back by accident though not outside the range it was designed to bend
30,0.926312991,0,in fact hes dropped it multiple times over the last year
39,0.26501968,0,screen has patch of missing pixels after months of use
32,0.99999673,0,edit after years of using it daily and almost never turning it off i replaced my whitebook with a retina mbp three years ago but the ol mb still handles basic computer tasks effortlessly
15,0.996906441,0,this lasted longer than our last chromebook but still didnt last years
2,0.998955998,1,so i will troubleshoot that and hopefully can use that eventually as a backup drive
15,0.928196805,0,i had in the last years a windows based laptop
17,0.954419487,0,it will work once if i wipereinstall the product never on subsequent boots

23,0.963418663,0,i downgraded this to two stars because of the bogus words that the battery will last hours
4,0.999999898,0,overall if youre a student on a budget looking for a reliable computer a refurbished macbook air is a reliable option and worth the money
15,0.99989133,0,before i started school last year i picked up a refurbished lenovo t and replaced its hdd with a spare ssd
4,0.337168352,0,the ram is also less than described
32,0.938829479,0,cons i have had it less than hours and the computer is unusable because of windows even after the update
14,0.34837227,0,in fact two regular drives do not compare
39,0.933495332,0,theres no excuse for a laptop in this price range not to be made out of aluminum
27,0.999999953,0,ive watched several movies already as well as used microsoft office not the trial version thats included but one i had purchased previously
23,0.99539621,0,the battery last forever and it turns on a second

15,0.705858375,0,the last one i used for years
38,0.999997931,0,with its portability retina display sleekness and overall quality it makes the journey of purchasing worth every penny
9,0.367541954,0,windows drivers will work too if any are missing
9,0.881825354,0,you will find idvd missing from the installed ilife package
39,0.912590886,0,in addition a lot of blows in the package from the outside
0,0.999691458,0,some of these changes can be made sans software but to me it was like a big samsung middle finger to me as an amd user
32,0.946672094,0,it freezes on websites regularly and i have to control alt delete to kill the session multiple times in an hour
33,0.921907924,1,it would be nice for future models to have a means of upgrading the drive or adding internal storage
0,0.99794279,0,everything can be run like its a regular desktop and then grab it and go when i need to and still have portability
36,1,1,the only reason i knocked it down start because it would be nice to have a quad core processor instead of the dual core and usb ports instead of usb and usb but you cant beat this little chromebook sized unit at
4,0.999971717,0,pro star offers the upgrade to the evo for i bought the same one here on amazon for upgrading to gb ram through prostar is another
14,0.999697256,0,it still left me with three extra slots one on the dongle a one on the hub and one on the laptop itself
15,0.866944674,0,reality we spent hours and hours working with two of them from the same store locally and both had issues

15,0.884672992,0,died after less than one year of ownership
9,0.999839022,0,youd expect a rpm drive to be a bit of a drag on performance
15,0.992715599,0,i was hesitant to buy a chromebook when i looked at them last year
0,0.789819422,0,but missing the touch screen feature already
17,0.890187778,0,frankly it should be international law that all laptops have upward facing speakers so that we can actually hear them
0,0.999887119,0,the overall feel of the laptop is solid again with the aluminum chassis carbon fiber wrapped keyboard area and glass touchpad powered by windows precision drivers
0,0.999708622,0,i do a lot of development in the cloud and make use of a lot of resources on the net and so reasoned i didnt need to cart around a regular laptop
31,0.999999997,0,i guess considering the price you get what you pay for but both my phone and samsung nook is faster than this laptop with less crashing and lag
9,1,1,however this computer could come with an ssd has its primary drive in stead of a rpm hdd buying a samsung ssd is something almost mandatory with this computer if you dont want a hard drive bottle neck i have a samsung evo ssd and i cant expect anymore speed from any computer
17,0.266815165,0,come back in a few hours
9,0.995330756,0,the next question you should ask yourself at this point is why do i need to use these specific programs
17,0.472662012,0,there are also less hardware components inside these things and therefore they are less prone to malfunctions
30,0.574127364,0,it literally takes me less than seconds to power up and log on

15,0.999739778,0,her last laptop was a dell inspiron and she was inclined toward the brand after years the motherboard was failing
39,0.731643776,1,i wish all other computers were this silent
39,0.997021178,1,aesthetics and build quality quite good and definitely better than the low price would suggest

23,0.960790275,0,my last laptop had a cellphone charger esk plug
15,0.999781794,0,i got this model as an upgrade to an hp convertible i purchased last year
38,0.999999997,0,it will not replace your regular pc or macbook pro but googles integrated office software and the app store makes this a competitive piece of hardware
5,0.999999881,0,i ordered mine had to wait about weeks for it plugged it in turned it on missing or corrupted operating system
17,0.999246498,0,then technician came to the house and replaced all the parts except the speakers weeks later had same power problem

32,0.994993649,0,from the second time i turned it on a blue screen appeared
30,0.999876857,0,after just a few months the usbs are acting up losing connection at the slightest movement of the cord
17,0.959451519,1,hopefully its under warranty because we need it for work and it would be down the drain ok as i could reuse the m possibly
25,0.996194675,0,the last laptop i purchased from asus had to be sent in for year adp warranty service twice
32,0.998581145,0,boot time is about half that of my hp and scrolling through several tabs appears to be instantaneous on this machine whereas there would be a white screen for a few milliseconds switching tabs on the hp

15,0.999978081,0,i purchased one chromebook last year its conveniently placed on the side table next to sofa
0,0.99982635,0,technically windows takes a lot of getting used to and requires ms office upgrade which is even harder to get used to
23,0.883726222,0,around hours regular browsing around to watching videos around gaming
0,0.999999891,0,despite that i do like it for how lightweight and portable it is that i can bring to and from home also to my classes without feeling like im carrying an extra ten pounds in combination to my text books for class
16,0.820754526,0,i left it on for a few hours before coming back to it
0,0.439908447,0,it probably takes a lot less resources to run
0,0.994352055,0,this chromebook was to replace a macbook air from a few generations back as a development machine using the cloud ide the setup is speedy and works well for the projects i have going
17,0.999997374,0,the repair guy i took the computer too who charged less than dell would have to fix it of course

1,0.99999651,0,have tried everything to see if its just power management or if it has to do with both nvidia and the regular control panel settings but no success
17,0.936510214,0,looks like windows crashed and subsequent to involving amazon support was unrecoverable
4,0.991389639,0,they offered their standard laptop repair at same price i payed for it

4,0.999788911,0,would recommend this to anyone that wants to double boot speed and performance of your laptop or desktop if you dont already have an ssd
19,0.999999992,0,but the part of me that just wants to listen to streaming music watch streaming videos network socially and read about the insanity also known as the human species is ecstatic that it doesnt have to sit in a stinky pile of techno dung to do all that
25,0.726300806,0,weight is a criticism i read in some reviews but it is actually less than the machine it replaced
27,0.898657179,0,my military retailer matched another local retailers price so got this for a bit over
39,0.996706865,1,while i love my chromebook there are areas which will hopefully be improved in successive models
36,0.999996886,1,of course it would be awesome to have a cd player but they are going defunct and it probably keeps it light
19,0.999989019,0,while its no powerhouse this laptop gets the job done if youre doing basic research or going on social media

0,0.999715476,0,the feeling youre left with is that once they have your money asus will do the bare minimum to support their products thats just not going to cut it today

34,0.999215475,0,spent over an hour with customer service barely speaks english
1,0.999999996,0,net result was a solid recovery and plenty of storage with a number of apps metro and desktop about min

25,0.999771144,0,i bought this because i needed a computer to write my senior thesis paper on and my regular laptop was on the fritz after the windows update
15,0.935937229,0,its a shame that i am returning this product because i thought it would last me a while
0,0.204980446,0,can you get a computer with the same specs for less
2,0.999991625,0,and thus acer won hopefully this was useful information if you were wondering how much extra this dedicated graphics card brings to the table
23,0.948477239,0,i would have to disagree about that number with regular usage
17,0.998822051,0,this is outside of the month return timeframe so my next step will be to contact lenovo to see if they can help

30,0.99074612,0,however in less than months the battery wont charge

28,0.99793788,0,overall this is a very solid gaming computer and it should handle anything you throw at it
23,0.987360139,0,i had problem with the battery it last not to longer
15,0.999927231,0,i had a hp amd laptop for the last years and when it came time to upgrade i purchased another one
17,0.99407342,0,i ordered two of these and both had the same problem namely aggravating loss of function on the left mouse buttondead cmos battery that i had to replace myself
0,0.555411069,1,it may be i missed a few drivers i hope but this is a serious problem to me
23,0.931021653,0,cons battery life is still less than i would have imagined
30,0.999999988,0,ditch your proprietary power cord make a trackpad that functions of the time and make the battery last longer
1,0.99961208,0,also it uses less power and puts off almost zero heat
28,1,0,for the slight power users out there that would like to add memory and capacity to their machine you do have the ability to add a hdd to the gb ssd and another ddr ram stick slots present with gb stick as it comes
32,0.99581097,0,i uninstalled some programs and reinstalled windows multiple times until one day it started crashing constantly blue screen
17,0.99995503,0,i have had dell support try to fix the above issues several times now and no luck
32,0.984482206,0,next day blue screen again same issue
32,0.999982746,0,within the second week this computer had the blue screen of death
0,0.60273092,0,this makes a portable computer less portable
4,0.999999426,0,the ram however is not upgradeable but i didnt think it worth another to get the next model up that had the gb of ram
4,0.999998885,0,i found and ordered the asus zb pro on amazon prime now same specs extra usb plus the k touchscreen for less than the dell no touchscreen no k and still less and within about hours
17,0.993076026,0,we have had this computer for months and of course you cant send it back because that window has closed
17,0.814908905,0,i had the computer less than month was still trying to set everything up
30,0.710190172,0,dont buy killer wifi adapter stopped working in less than hours of use
39,0.997143894,1,im sure it would be nice to have dual p touch screens but then youve got two screens to keep clean
24,1,1,right now i dont have a lot of confidence in it ever working i bought what i thought would be a new notebook but it seems to me after all the problems that we have had to endure that it is not new but abused
15,0.995369267,0,i found this t from esales connect it was the last one they had in stock at the time of my purchase
32,0.999986645,0,but it crashed garbled purple screen on the second day i had it and after less than a week now freezes fairly regularly
33,0.996678781,1,since a portion of my free time is recording music it would be great if it did that but it doesnt and that is fine
30,0.999997035,0,at the end of the third year the battery had to be replaced and the logic board was starting to have issues with wifi connection
32,0.452352776,0,ive had this computer less than a week
23,0.999972395,0,charge time from lows around remaining life to is a bit less than hours
17,0.9955408,0,all was well until a half hour later when my son said it turned off
0,0.999254708,0,one caveat after getting used to these speeds you can never go back to using regular computers
4,0.9815854,0,i will not be purchasing an asus product ever again as this experience has left a sour taste in my mouth
16,0.975879571,0,also on my spotify account i can no longer drag playlists or songs and re arrange them
38,0.995618449,0,slimness of design is no excuse for lack of a swapable ram module
0,0.997441083,0,i still occasionally have problems with the mouse however the cursor will literally disappear from the screen i have no idea where it goes the digital void
15,0.910962514,0,it was the change i was looking for after dealing with pcs for the last years
33,1,1,i wasnt expecting very much for the amount of money but honestly a computer at this price should be able to open up a computer program like google chrome or microsoft word in under three minutes
0,0.994246711,0,the uxca wont stay in portrait view and constantly wants to switch back to landscape while re enabling the keyboard and trackpad
15,0.999498164,0,i bought one for my wife last year
30,0.999754551,0,i wont bore you with specs but between the cell dell and cell lenovo there is less time on battery
7,0.999355652,0,my last computer i have had for years still works but cant be updated anymore because its an apple
39,1,1,thanks the good product well packaged protected when arrived could probably throw the box down a flight of stairs and it the laptop would be fine within stays very cool ran a stress test and heavy gaming processor topped out at c gpu also well within limits optimus works fine only places needed programs on discrete graphics otherwise used integrated camera is pretty nice not super hq but nice screen is plenty bright indoors not sure what a lot of people were complaining about backlight not overpowering on keyboard chiclet like keyboard very comfortable to type on full number pad but keys are laid out differently elbo power cable bluetooth
4,0.921054028,0,the price of this laptop is about less than what comparable machines are
0,0.99994864,0,it also supports navigating forward and back with two fingers although this gesture is definitely less responsive than with apples trackpad
15,0.994128469,0,this is the second time i have bought one of these last time it was the gb and it was installed on a pc
32,0.999732549,0,edit i had been having issues with my showing up in my computer after waking from sleep that started a few months back
33,0.999977261,1,one would like to think that asus support would know this or that they would be updating their drivers as intel updates the generic version
19,1,0,i guess it will last for hrs based on my usage internet surfing youtube facebook typing stuff and amazon shopping of course
30,0.753819879,0,the computer started acting up less than six months from purchase
23,0.949621058,0,it does have a con for me battery doesnt last hours of illustrating on a row for me
34,0.999999997,1,i would love if device manufacturers would just be honest about their battery life estimates hopefully someone finds this information helpful
39,0.993820508,1,it would be wonderful to have a backlit keyboard even though it would shorten the laptops battery life
23,0.999715289,0,if you have last years model with the dedicated graphics card depending on what you use it for it may not be worth the upgrade
38,0.999999916,0,i switched to apple products after years of cursing windows and android based systems spending on two macbook pros and an iphone c within the last year
32,0.999998969,0,i bought my hp on line from one of the shopping channels last month my dell had lost its color and everything on the screen is red after years
15,0.999989207,0,i have a lot of chromebooks and i have purchased acer cs since the release last year
15,0.901847934,0,no doubt this will last me a couple years
39,0.675860916,0,con upgrade to windows lost auto switch from inside screen to outside screen
17,0.99956135,0,so after minutes of waiting and thinking i was experiencing the same issue with this asus laptop i powered it off turned it back on again
19,0.999136432,1,it would be a great gift to someone who needs a computer or as a second to go computer
4,0.862983578,0,theres a few options with gb cards and ips displays for less money
16,0.999999335,0,any alternate boot from an external usb device done at the bios level will display in portrait mode instead of in landscape mode
39,0.363159309,0,this gives me less than hours depending on how im using it
32,0.999999993,0,do not buy this computer windows on updated the computer using the windows update service updated the graphics drivers causing the computer to blue screen with the video scheduler internal error
27,0.999999828,0,i have already recommended this hp stream x to several friends and do recommend this hybrid with its limited memory
15,0.67253216,0,i just started gaming the last two years lotro
39,0.999983177,1,it would be nice if the case had smaller access panels to you can access the hd memory and the wifi card with out disassembling the computer case
30,1,1,i would suggest avoiding razer products at all costs the company as a whole cares very little for their customers my story i purchased a razer blade and after approximately a year pretty much immediately after the base warranty ended the power adapter stopped being recognized by the system and thus the battery would not charge
15,0.999989799,0,never owned an apple product before but i realized as soon as i started using this thing that i had been missing out
25,0.881570286,1,i just bought a powerline adapter so i can wire in the xbox one and hopefully thatll get it up to speed
23,0.812690186,0,it will maybe last hours without you having to recharge
39,0.609406457,0,thats less than my hp dx weighed without its battery
33,0.980618236,1,it would be easier to simply use android have access to all the apps or the other and there have been rumors that they merge unlikely but possible
39,0.999593248,1,i wish the screen was ips but for this price point i was able to get gb vs which my advisor said would improve the performance
8,0.234589821,0,programs crash regularly
23,0.999828106,0,the battery life of this inspiron just last for to hours maximum
19,0.876590808,1,its my daily grinder and will continue to be for a couple more years hopefully
9,0.985798915,0,this computer had about gb less storage space than advertised
33,0.999998621,1,my other concern was that it would be slow but i have been able to have over a dozen tabs open and continue to work at full speed
15,0.963667248,0,even last years toshiba xg was faster than the xg
0,0.999595059,0,the screen at inches is actually a big difference over a ten inch tablet screen
0,0.248022432,0,not what you want when youve had it for less than hours
25,0.998718324,0,i dont know what id do if it had happened well outside of warranty
15,0.219000701,0,all of this in less than two hours
15,0.973883677,0,i already have an asus c that i bought last year
39,0.996906193,1,it would be nice if there was a cover of some sort to protect the keyboard
25,0.996926005,0,then just outside of warranty the screen cracked
12,1,1,but that would also cost me about with tax and it would be nice to have a more natural way to access the windows world rather then the unwieldy bootcamp option
32,0.512158852,0,for the last couple of months hes had issues with the screen freaking out as he says
14,0.99999949,0,were this my daily use system id have an external keyboard at the office to use anyway so it wouldnt be a big deal
39,0.999999843,1,it would be nice to have ssd drive but actually the stock drive works really well just slower boot ups is all i have really noticed
32,0.999998223,0,occasionally the screen goes blank for a minute and a message appears that there was a driver issue again not often and hasnt been a big deal
10,1,1,this computer hopefully now that jobs is gone who knows what the quality is really like my iphone has been a disappointment recently will hopefully last me another years
9,0.997975543,0,in performance i cant complain of this computer i can do some gaming with no worry of overheat because of its big fans in the back
15,0.983470316,0,i bought a macbookpro it did not even last year
30,0.998982201,0,this one just barely last years before the connection from the battery to the cord went bust

9,0.999801812,0,less an owners manual or any type of recovery disk or flash drive
0,0.999909292,0,i even plug chromebooks in to the projectors in the classroom both the samsung and acer cb have hdmi out instead of using the less reliable windows desktop computers that are built into the class
33,0.834098488,1,a computer should be able to be dependable for more than months
17,0.995350559,0,if i want to spend the second half of my day in the backyard working or the living room it will hold charge for those hours with no issues
0,0.366045242,0,my last was a samsung with an i and screen
23,0.923329846,0,battery would last about hours
17,0.999991337,0,i call back and repair system is down called back a few days later again and they say they are out of parts to fix it
17,0.997347279,0,they sent me a ups mailing label and we will be returning it for a refund less the restocking fee
27,1,0,if you still have a system image backup from another computer and want to try keep all your installed applications intact instead of reinstalling all from scratch then here goes note my previous laptop was an hp pavilion from several years ago
39,0.93163324,0,the increased ram and intel processor ensures that its going to last a while unlike the arm processor thats in the hp
25,0.999999999,0,theres also a screw hole under a very generic looking warranty voiding sticker from what ive read it doesnt actually void the warranty if you remove the sticker to get to the screw
32,0.999438802,0,my last laptop i had was a tba from bt by theres your brain teaser for the day and the screen started screwing up a couple months after the warranty ran out
30,0.996740417,0,as a result i dont expect the power supply to last
4,0.998206801,0,cons crappy generic ssd not even worth being nvme at the readwrite speeds it offers

39,0.999001431,1,i love the product but got it in terrible condition and disappointed in customer servicei would like to let you know that im really upset with the products i got from jr
23,0.988413997,0,not something id expect with a battery that is supposed to last hours
23,0.528870484,0,when i saw this laptop advertised with a windows operating system at less than for the basic model i knew this was going to be my official school laptop
25,0.982442088,1,if you decide to purchase this computer i hope you have better luck with it than i have
32,0.982505105,0,locks up daily with a blue screen
35,1,0,whether it is for you depends on your needs but for me this laptop replaces quite a few devices that i would otherwise need to do what i want to do whether it is for programming in visual studio gaming reading news writing emails reading books on kindle handwritten note taking in meetings on onenote etc
15,0.988336507,0,is this the last computer i ever buy
8,0.998915268,0,in photoshop cc the text is not workable with the regular display view
28,0.999999517,1,well intel core i u and gb of rams should be able to handle most of the applications ive run on a daily basis

23,0.999999645,0,the battery life on battery saving mode will get less than minutes worth and the power dc jack has already blown once
10,0.99999876,1,it doesnt have all the bells whistles of other laptops on the market but for the price quality i hope this lasts for quite some time
39,0.997843784,0,retina lbsi could also eliminate the price and ram criteria now since all models were gb and price variation was less than model storage battery display weight pro gb hrs
23,0.958877572,0,if you do not use it for entertainment it can last around hours
25,0.999031712,0,third party sellers cant be trusted in my years experience as a regular amazon customer

25,0.983804745,1,i was told it would be processed in hours however weeks later when i hadnt yet received it i called asus to inquire about the charger and they told me they didnt have that information
39,0.984373338,1,it would be nice if at this price they provided a carraige for the case
32,0.999742034,0,not minutes later the blue screen showed up again and the computer restarted

19,0.812379586,0,i would recommend this computer to anyone that uses a computer on a regular basis
27,0.772729619,0,it less memory and lower cpu then the hp i have now
23,0.84376921,0,i get about hrs in regular usage flipping between movies gaming and productivity
3,0.99999999,0,according to tech support you could install another gb memory in same standard and install ssd drives as raid
32,0.793492988,0,the screen is still showing on the outside screen
15,0.99972197,0,this will probable be the last dell product that i will ever buy
23,0.999999961,0,charges with a universal usb cable which means that my mwh external battery charger will work to charge my iphone ipad and now the asusthe battery life
15,0.99980878,0,i wouldnt buy another dell product if their laptop is going to last less than a year

25,0.999999475,0,they said the third party company they send these to for repairs deemed ours physically damaged and the warranty was void
12,0.99995613,1,it would be nice to have the physical volume control option laid out easier to adjust
7,0.999926459,0,ive spent the last five hours running diagnostics to get it working again
32,0.999947407,0,windows runs somewhat unstable on my device as i am experience multiple blue screen crashes and the touchscreen failing to register gestures
32,0.999599068,0,i would have the laptop turned at and have it at after after half an hour of working on my desktop i would go back on the laptop and see it at or
9,0.879206928,0,this is the last model with dvd drive
23,0.887145187,0,the battery does not last
17,0.999999935,0,on the local site its not even advertised update the nearest service center that i could find on the international website turned out to be a garbage recycling facility
16,1,0,my biggest complaint is that the on off switch is on the left side of the laptop and i have to life it to find the button to depress it to turn it on or restart it after its gone to sleep
9,0.999979123,0,it keeps dropping wifi all the time it stopped playing sounds because of a missing driver we had to re install it
0,0.999935543,1,being that it has an arm processor i wish there was a way to install android on it and run it off of the same linux kernel so one can switch back and forth between the two without having to restart
17,0.999995608,0,after being asked the same questions three times the automated system told me it would connect me to a rep then i got another recording which told me to try again later and hung up
0,0.525572196,0,dont laugh on some netbooks and even notebooks the viewing angles can be so limited that even if your head is centered relative to the screen some part of the screen will be shaded washed out or diffracted
32,0.988443325,0,i think the last non glossy screen i used was my desktop computer back in the day
33,0.998415185,0,this should make a solid daily use laptop for me for several years provided i remain cognizant of its limitations and take care of it
17,0.571228546,0,several hours later it was still the same way
0,0.999780312,0,i thought it was a regular size laptop but thats my fault
15,0.999926235,1,so far this laptop is the perfect computer to replace my aging year old asus gaming laptop it had dedicated graphics too and hopefully it will serve me for another years
32,0.76229038,0,i have a few days left and i think im going to return this computer
19,0.999423519,0,if you like alt tabing and running things in the background like tv shows or what not the computer can get a bit bogged and hold up for a second
30,0.838729554,0,i was on the internet and downloading software on this laptop for over hours the last two days and the battery is still on
17,0.980031187,0,one moment it says theres ten hours of charge left and the next it goes down to three
23,0.964434244,0,besides the battery life is less than hours
17,0.921901522,0,after it asked me for some info it took me back to the same screen
39,0.999988427,1,honestly though there are circumstances it would be nice to have the rear camera such as when you want to put a picture in your onenotes but since onenotes is free your phone camera still works for this as well
16,0.999981308,0,after min run time after initial power up and not opening any programs the cpu is still running at or close to it every few seconds
16,0.999861161,1,it would be nice to leave the key board attached to the power and just detach the screen for use
15,0.248208981,0,my computer has stayed with me less than its traveled to them
0,0.999993203,0,ive actually been using the touch screen while taking notes in class actually quite useful
19,0.99568743,0,this just in if youre using or and congratulating yourself know that said telemetry snooping features capturing every last keyboard stroke and reporting in has just been added as a feature to and
25,0.998817872,0,like others have said the screen is garbage and stops working in less than a year
32,0.997300041,0,im fed up with the laptop and i requested a return last two times the disk cleanup has started working
14,0.999998723,1,theres only a single usb connection it would be nice to have one or two more although the one can obviously be bridged and theres an hdmi output
16,0.95818441,0,a few initial thoughts after having it for five days the cpu was a big area of concern for me
17,0.999984981,0,contacted acer predator dedicated support i am told that the kits have been missing in some computers and are shipped separately on request
8,0.791467651,0,the display drive regularly reboots or the computer restarts
25,0.98975466,0,the last fix was to get the matte cover off the screen
9,0.502973281,0,it turns out this was a hardware issue and therefore i had to send this back less than weeks after purchase
39,1,1,here are my pros and cons pros very fast with the i and ssd this baby is super fast it boots up in about seconds screen is amazing hard not to when vizio is a lead competitor in the tv market sleek and thin this thing is very thin and fairly light yet feels durable because of the aluminum case cons being so thin the speakers are not very loud because they are obviously not very big the keys on the keyboard take some getting used to windows it would be nice if it was a touch screen but with windows gestures its easy to get the hang of it
17,0.999998255,0,when i call back they tell me that a member of that department will call me at a specific day and time and then i get no call
32,0.797692185,0,less than one star computer easly damaged and they wont do anything about it
23,0.999999983,0,when im at school with the fully charged battery and turn it on battery saver the battery will last well over hours
6,1,0,when i last checked the asus website page for this computer i didnt see any mention of the resized sd card slot or the addition to the keyboard
15,0.99999189,0,i cant think of anything else to review but i already know about chromebooks since ive had one since last year
14,0.999991184,0,there is no standard external monitor port and not even an adapter included
14,0.999889753,0,attached a dvd rom external drive visit usb and still no success
33,0.999987724,0,my laptop arrived without any paperwork so i was missing the one year office and tb onedrive storage offer
17,0.999914893,0,i have spent several hours on the phone with them attempting to troubleshoot and nothing has worked
23,0.999618642,0,for basic internet surfing the battery tends to last about hours for me with the screen brightness to about
17,0.996790621,0,they proceeded to ship the missing parts to me and told me that id have to install them myself
39,0.999758163,1,i have had this for about months and the screen cracked making it so i can not use the touch screen i wish i could just buy a new screen and replace it but i can not find any
39,0.999999036,0,the screen might have a lower resolution than the one on the samsung chromebook pro but for less you get twice the storage and a backlit keyboard so this was a no brainer for me
4,0.999978066,0,its worth the to upgrade since youre investing in gb ram anyway why waste it
0,0.999503074,0,i have owned my chromebook for less than years and my initial opinion was that it was useful for its lightweight portability
30,0.999027971,0,yet i have had some wifi issues over the last year with lenovo and had read about wifi issues with the yoga
15,0.90397888,0,if it goes in less than to years im done with toshiba
14,1,0,id use it all the time but ive never gotten the hang of typing on a laptop style keyboard yes i know i can dock a wireless keyboard to it but i have space issues where i use this to study and to type the simplest thing takes me forever unless im in front of a regular keyboard
25,0.996773379,0,a few hours later the screen did not show i contacted asus
39,0.984266413,0,on a screen of this quality you would expect nothing less than perfection much less the price
30,0.999999852,0,last night my wifi dropped i tried to reconnect and it said there were no wireless routers within range
25,0.7985681,0,booting computer went from like seconds to less than
0,0.936081319,0,regular updates would take hours according to the laptop
10,1,1,so when i saw this i thought it would be perfect to take places and to have with me when im just browsing the web on the couch or in bed
32,0.991488418,0,three and half years later it stopped working not powering on at all
32,0.567044966,0,the screen already internally cracked in less than month of having it
4,0.887083754,0,this is unacceptable for any computer much less one in this price range
25,0.657898681,0,charger stopped working less than a year after purchase
31,0.994919606,0,it is being returned for a regular sized and reliable laptop
32,0.992439017,0,i went away for a few hours and came back to a repaired machine
27,0.999999892,0,i keep track of all kinds of stuff surf social plus ive built lots of docs using drive
0,0.991396172,0,i would never buy a big ticket item off the net again
32,0.999644629,0,a week and a half later i recieved and it work for a week and now back to the same blue screen
15,0.87342931,0,purchased of these over the last years
31,0.999999641,0,so i sold my last macbook i still use mac mini at home and tried this rugged but lightweight chromebook
0,0.505405756,0,it comes preinstalled with windows which is a winner much less jarring to the windows user than or
23,0.887145187,0,battery last for a while
38,0.998428957,0,it rivals my all solid state drive macbook in terms of overall speed
28,0.999999997,0,my model has gb ram tb hdd and a gb ssd th gen i processor and a mid range dedicated graphics card all for less than
32,0.98738317,0,even then though using hibernate when it comes back up it still blue screens about of the time
33,0.777107295,1,it would be a great computer if it didnt
39,0.873444761,1,hopefully more downloads will be available in the future
33,0.999996274,1,my chromebook only has gb of memory and while that is probably more than enough for a chromebook since the idea is to store everything in the cloud it would be nice to know that i might be able to download a few movies if i needed to
30,0.998344329,0,less than a year and i started having problems with the unit not always turning on
33,0.999418193,1,it would be nice to be able to watch some videos from a flash drive when internet is unavailable
4,0.998212442,0,when i was searching around for extra ram for my imac mid i came across this product
14,0.925549652,0,i am one who prefers glossy displays and this one has no antiglare coating but its not unusable outside either
27,1,0,it may be worth noting that the color of the logo on the back seems to not be adjustable stays red for me as i thought it would automatically change to whatever color the keyboard was set to be
8,0.876255581,0,go back to previous programs for those who do not wish to interact with their computers as tablets and use this program for your tablets
17,0.999998042,0,i spent hours online with the dell technician and had to send back to dell for repairs they replaced the screen
0,0.986734769,0,this is my second one got it because it does everything the big guys do and its portable
15,0.999845739,0,this is the last time i will ever buy a computer through amazon
31,0.78935737,0,it is less than the price of fixing her laptop
15,0.995497918,0,i think a laptop should last longer than a year when you pay for it
33,0.99993023,0,in less than ten seconds i have this thing powered up and surfing the internet or doing whatever else i want it to do
23,0.987907767,0,ive tested the internet on multiple speed test sites and they all return the same results
10,0.99996369,1,so my plan is to have it repaired and covered by amex and hopefully it will last for another few years
25,0.983250921,0,if you have even the tiniest of problems you will enter the vortex of hell that is dells excuse for customer service
0,0.949536106,0,occasionally this computer with disable the internet and you cant get it back on until you uninstall and then let it re install
14,0.999981356,0,however the internal wireless modem stopped working a week after i bought it and i had to buy an external usb modelm to access internet
33,0.999993077,0,moving from a windows based laptop to this has me missing skype calls and i cant run a specific program from my school to set up a vpn
39,0.994159358,1,it would be nice to know the reason for the screen to change like it did
25,0.982871245,0,the service was just outside of my price range
15,0.984363805,0,this is last product of hp for me
17,0.929037322,0,so less time i can bill them for waiting for my computer to boot up the happier they are as well
23,0.692495087,0,i remember the day when people brought products built to last
17,0.996912042,0,edited paragraph on my last day before shipping the computer back it got stuck on a continuous bootload
5,0.999999997,0,received this product today and when it was powered up it said the operating system was damaged or missing
23,0.999956577,0,playing games on the battery will last you maybe an hour
0,0.975481814,0,lastly i would add something about the screen
0,0.995163013,0,this newer model freezes multiple times daily is actually slower
19,1,1,it would be a great first computer for a student maybe a gift for someone who just needs to browse the web and send email but it just wasnt quite enough for me
23,0.999939232,0,even after a year the battery will last for hours and sometimes up to or if i lower the brightness setting
31,0.987224913,0,i spent several hours reloading my apps to the samsung pro
6,0.999750608,0,at this point just a few fairly standard programs had been installed minecraft and skype
15,0.879295734,0,i received the product last week
9,0.999999959,0,i was intrigued by the capability to add a second ssd via the additional sata port and although i have yet to do so i will be adding a second drive in the future
39,0.979157143,0,i had to move some files off to a second drive to make room for it but that was well worth it and i dont need picture files on my ssd
1,0.967496817,0,but the trade off is less power consumption and a cooler running machine
0,0.999919618,0,i still use a macbook air and find it slowcumbersome pushing harder in corners or trying to drag objects with the trackpad
17,0.999998147,0,i spent several hours on the phone with both microsoft customer service as well as dell
23,0.92246787,0,the battery would last an hour as i inched out of a year
16,0.966125732,0,the thing charges completely in less than hours and my experience has been that it holds a charge anywhere between and hours depending on what you are doing
25,0.96883226,1,if you are buying this computer i hope you have a taste for lemon juice cuz thats what mine tastes like
32,0.793308046,0,the one downside to me is that the screen is almost unusable outside
14,0.922322698,0,my recommendation buy the same spec laptop from cyberpowerpc minus the raid for to less monies or get this with the gtx
15,0.920839302,0,been using this since the last years with no problems
16,0.993851265,0,i did not used the acer blue screen protection as colors were disturbed and screen became yellow in appearance
33,0.72978381,0,prosamazing screen qualitycan it handle adobe programs several at the same time
27,0.999995314,0,when i recreate my google account on the machine all the previously installed apps come back automatically
32,0.992229092,0,so i returned the last hp pavilion chromebook because it died upon updating chrome os the system asks you to do so
32,0.993279307,0,barely usable without a second display
15,0.716150997,0,i used the warranty on my last computer and it saved me lots of money
17,0.999996533,0,so after a lengthy talk with technical support i send it back in wait another week and get it back
15,0.248208981,0,the computer boots up in less than seconds
17,0.818704146,0,blinking keyboard i have a yoga pro and just outside of warranty it stopped working
0,0.324133146,0,now who use regular computer
25,0.99708489,0,there is no excuse to pay close to dollars and have just a crappy product
39,0.955426232,1,with windows even an average user should be able to reinstall windows on their own now
14,1,0,one thing im keen on is that you can actually charge the laptop via the usb type c port also a thunderbolt port on the left side
14,0.996253301,0,one thing this really is missing is a ethernet port
32,0.999843129,0,i started getting a blue screen of death daily now
0,0.999986852,0,the flip feature is neat and useful but the touchscreen alone is worth the price for those moments youd rather just flick the screen or tap than use the keyboard
15,0.999242514,0,beyond the physical hardware itself i find nothing useful about the chromebook design at all
32,0.496751307,0,its raised in the back with venting and fan for cooling the inner parts
5,0.999999065,0,it gave a blue screen error about a missing device and listed keys to press to troubleshoot the problem
17,0.958551241,0,i will no longer go with asus considering this is the second replacement computer with the same issue
19,0.999999946,0,decided to go with this computer for her browsing youtube email social networking bill pay etc
39,0.999317083,1,its incredibly easy and relatively quick and with chrome rdp hopefully gaining compatibility in r the experience may even be better
39,0.99999965,1,the laptop is still working great except that i wish this model had a kensington security lock slot to hold a security lock cable
39,0.522383863,0,you could buy an i equipped rocket for less money but twice the weight
8,0.958855536,0,using google docs and google drive i have no need for my regular pc
0,0.988761063,0,my child has had this computer less than months and already she is having problem with the mouse pad
0,0.985370882,0,or rather opposite of how you would drag a touch screen
23,0.999639972,0,edit laptop battery wear level is already at after less then a couple years and the battery dies off the charger in less than minutes
15,0.999592108,0,got this for christmas last year for college
32,0.903264431,0,my last computer took over a minute
15,0.672235778,0,i am switching from a macbook air after using it exclusively for the last years
4,0.972865375,0,overall this laptop really worth this price
17,0.999999776,0,called in a computer service company and was told to send it back because the processor will not function properly
15,0.955015704,0,less than a year before it is on its last leg
15,0.975858187,0,and because of that this will be my last lenovo product
8,0.856216005,0,my regular computer is a mac mini
32,0.994396921,0,opened and closed the screen multiple times
4,0.914471759,0,i think this laptop will definitely last us years
15,0.982036964,0,i bought this last year
15,0.960330807,0,didnt last a year
4,0.990273009,0,overall it is not worth the price
30,0.975608301,1,i wish the screen could be rotated further back and the power cord to be longer
30,0.974850665,0,i have adjusted the power settings in an attempt to make it last longer
25,0.889913899,0,you cant install programs outside of browser plug ins
28,0.999998578,0,with the solid state drive and the fan less cpu there are no moving parts to wear out
39,0.999990528,1,its a beautiful laptop the design and material are top notch is super fast i love the display i would like that have a extra usb port but its okay i recommend anyone to buy it
23,0.9989325,0,battery lifeapple claims hours to a charge compared with hours on last years model
15,0.967483288,0,ive had this chromebook for less than a year
39,1,1,why was it on there and other non essential stupid programs explored w some sucky bits there but hey its microsoft whaddya want im gon na curse under my breath or loudly depending on any more issues there because we hates it my precious namely setting default programs for file types it wouldnt let me choose from programs only what it thinks is logical grrrr now loading the one game that i hope to really test out the graphics card on hopefully it will be a nice surprise should be since this is an upgrade from my old lappy
35,1,1,if there were truly any complaints i have had with this laptop it would have to be that the included bloatware can be fairly annoying if not uninstalled not truly the laptops fault but when mcafee constantly asks you to pay up then youll understand what i mean booting for the first time as well as coming off of sleep mode can drag on sometimes roughly seconds thanks to the hdd and the webcam is one of the absolute worse webcams i have ever seen
2,1,0,you can put a micro sd card in the chromebook for extra internal storage although im just relying on google drive at the moment
13,1,1,now it is too soon to know if they are going to be a problem but a tip from the digital camera that my wife has small rubber plugs attached to the body that you pop out and they stay attached until you are done would be nice and keep the look clean when everything is covered and protected
25,0.766464618,1,hopefully customer service can send a working product
39,0.988360043,1,it would be nice if they similarly provided a more thorough guide to all the features on the chromebook such as the camera which i still havent figured out
17,0.999999095,0,but if the product doesnt work seamlessly out of the box im not going to waste my time trying to troubleshoot it over an outsourced customer relationship line
23,0.991570286,0,battery life significantly less than stated
25,0.998110995,0,also had issues with the display just outside of warranty
33,0.998169852,1,while it would be nice to have microsoft office on here i can do everything i need for school through google docs
4,0.999998016,0,however if you do your research and know what this product is i would still give it a star rating if i paid regular price
19,0.999997765,0,they also offer the ability to watch hulu and netflix with subscriptions not included and use social media
15,0.990218798,0,last computer i bought was an asus problematic as it was a desktop and tech support in india
23,0.604515261,0,the system boots fully in less than fifteen seconds
4,0.999997964,1,the windows home edition isnt too big a deal as a home user the added benefits of the pro version are few but it would be nice to have an upgrade option
9,0.999961283,0,avoid this laptop the last one i had was a i and it even ran a d modeling program this one can not even handle adobe reader properly
28,0.998579885,0,the and inch versions have the same internal hardware cpu ram emmc storage
15,0.989524253,0,supposed to be warrantied for a year but they yelled at me and told me its days and hung up on me last time i called
14,0.283475386,0,lastly is the color of the laptop
32,0.948819776,0,for example i charged to and less than an hour later it was already at
23,0.998563832,0,i monitored the battery status during that time and i think it did last through about hours of use plus the standby
15,0.999229766,0,probably my last hp product ever
39,0.980362344,1,i wish the screen were a little brighter
0,0.980513002,0,this is a solid and reliable choice for a regular laptop user
7,0.999688346,0,i cant tell if this is actually a model as i cant confirm that dell updated this computer since its initial release
17,0.998402779,0,i am a few months out of warranty so it will be several hundred dollars to fix
0,0.994458645,0,secondly like any computer it will need to be restarted occasionally to do anything
4,0.996957326,0,overall i believe the computer was worth the purchase
23,0.967898378,0,after researching for about a month for one with a dedicated graphics card that would last me for several years i threw this one into my wishlist and settled on saving for it
23,0.887145187,0,the battery is rated to last hours
19,0.999999373,1,we watch tv and movies mainly via streaming so i thought that it would be nice to have my laptop back while my daughter is watching cartoons on netflix
27,0.998196511,0,subsequently my operating system microsoft office applications and all games have been loaded to my gb ssd
23,0.843885117,0,i have been trying to install the upgrade windows for the last hours
39,0.999999291,1,i had to order a second one of these because the first one was password protected this one has no camera and sometimes i think it is going to crash as the screen flickers however the price was what i could afford and it is so far working fine and hopefully it will last for a couple years like my last refurb did
19,0.995346642,0,its not a gaming powerhouse but he does manage to run some less graphically intensive games on it with no problem
7,0.99992618,0,last month i decided to give my mobile pcs a rest not to mention my batterieshot battery killing my cell phones
15,0.988472529,0,i bought this computer last year just started using it
23,0.850411054,0,i have been charging this computer for the last hours and the battery is still at
15,0.999954067,0,less than a year ago i purchased this microsoft surface product
32,0.860546915,0,i had windows on the previous computer but this is probably a later version
33,0.997922473,0,but it says it is missing google chrome which it should have already been installed and now it says to missing or damaged
23,0.999695543,0,battery at brightness the battery will last hours
15,0.970532875,0,i got this laptop last year when it just got launched
16,0.241735615,0,i have left it for hours and still the same
16,0.999945172,0,it vents the heat onto the screen but the upper bottom half of the laptop also heats up
39,0.964664394,1,it would be nice to have a cddvd driver built in for downloads and movie viewing
17,0.998812913,0,after the initial boot up it spent several hours trying to update itself
32,0.694309713,0,my computer goes from the desktop to reboot and back to desktop in less than seconds now
15,0.998990478,0,ive bought this chromebook when i was last week in england and i was leaving from luton airport
19,0.999629346,1,the verdict on this is that it would be great for someone that doesnt need it to watch videos or use this for heavy entertainment
32,0.896732143,0,im working on a book and three times within the last month the computer crashed
17,0.511912627,0,i see them on ebay and amazon for hundreds less for newer models
19,0.999991188,0,our basic needs web browsing hd video playback social media media center

39,0.964950717,0,i just got this one for my wife she had another macbook before without the superdrive much less memory and hd
38,0.999999914,0,along the way some foolish executive decided that the extra ten dollars in patent licensing fees to equip usb c instead of surface connect wasnt worth it
23,0.927765257,0,about fifty minutes of gameplay and four hours of regular use
17,0.578548545,0,sent back within a few hours of receiving

37,1,0,im not making this up everything i just listed has happened to me several times in the last hour and a half and all i want to do was save some pictures from my email
15,0.893653899,0,i dont think it will last a year
28,0.95916133,0,for those of you complaining this thing cost less than a cell phone
15,0.997886276,0,well i bought this computer for my son less than months ago
15,0.67708628,0,i have watched this laptop over the last months and the price has fluctuated from about and
39,0.999877705,1,that being said it would be great if producers of pc products could figure out how to combine powerful hardware and high quality components namely keyboards and trackpads
16,0.999897048,1,neither of these issues are deal breakers however if i begin to use the laptop away from home more often it would be nice to have something with a longer battery life
39,0.999620903,1,only have two gripes i wish it had backlit keys and i wish the screen could tilt back just a little more
39,0.999896389,1,the chromebook generally does all of those things and if it worked consistently it would be a great low cost computer for what it was designed to do
19,0.999999955,0,for surfing the web doing research and keeping in touch with friends via social media there is nothing out there that will do what this will for the price
30,0.378578592,0,system board went out in less than weeks

10,0.999989557,1,i was able to block hopefully forever the metro screen where i will not be purchasing anything
36,1,1,the only reason i knocked it down start because it would be nice to have a quad core processor instead of the dual core and usb ports instead of usb and usb but you cant beat this little chromebook sized unit at

10,0.99999876,1,it doesnt have all the bells whistles of other laptops on the market but for the price quality i hope this lasts for quite some time
4,0.960665745,0,also the model i received was worth between and less than the one i paid for
15,0.469864196,0,what i like it does last the hours
8,1,1,there are also fewer options every app requires internet connectivity to work fullyfor some reason google decided it would be a great idea to limit the functionality of its apps if the computer isnt connected to the internet

39,0.682726265,0,i put every settings on performance over quality the battery stays up haf hrs sumtyms less
0,0.308772943,0,less than years isnt acceptable
15,0.966556011,0,one last thing this computer comes with windows out of the box
0,0.932298766,1,i wished this screen has resolution of x instead of x
32,0.853833519,0,i bought it years back and the battery stopped charging few months back
30,0.998517469,0,he purchased it a few months ago but you know how it is when youve used the same software for several years in this case or
39,0.999871963,1,it would be actually great if hp provides an option with gb ssd
23,0.738855549,0,the battery didnt last months
25,0.737041419,0,broke in less then a year
23,0.675827995,0,battery charges from and fills up in minutes or less
9,0.924243633,0,also the wifi kicks me off regularly while my partner is sitting next to me on her laptop with no problems
15,0.937234289,0,i do wish it gave us regular office instead of the year subscription
23,0.747048111,0,it fits in my bag and is less cumbersome for the airport crew to handle ive had them drop one by the way
30,0.999643522,1,i wish that the battery lasted longer yet as with most of my complaints given the price it is completely understandable
17,0.980026342,0,after researching this issue online i see several people have the same issue with no resolution
23,0.887145187,0,battery last hours
27,0.95941838,0,i built my previous system and several others
0,0.296183909,0,it stops so that the screen can be propped up but it makes it less versatile
1,0.9999979,0,hardwareprocessor the th generation haswell i u processor is snappy yet less power hungry than a third generation one
32,0.999779345,0,browsing the internet i would see a white flickering line in the middle of the screen when scrolling down
25,0.999731033,0,i then wrote to the third party company and asked the same question
39,0.99433176,1,it feels a bit heavy to me in terms of true portability especially for having plastic parts i wish it felt more sturdy
32,0.614728367,0,ive had mine less than a week and had to powerwash twice
23,0.999503154,0,battery power it supposed to last hours depends on the settings
27,0.996177866,0,not worth the price had a lot of problems with it and sent back
28,0.999624499,0,this specific model does not have the levels of red vents as pictured there is no blu ray
28,0.999999283,0,i did pick this up at target since it is on sale this week for plus cartwheel gives you an extra plus red card another
9,0.999999315,0,yes ddr ram memory does work this system comes with ddrl sodimm and for the life of me i could not find a definitive answer if regular ddr sodimm ram would work
9,0.999999828,0,if you choose to upgrade the computers ram you must get one that is ddrl not ddr because the l stands for lowpower so if you were to get the regular ram it would not work
15,0.960399043,0,i have been using this laptop since last year without any issue
17,0.855553775,0,ran several hours worth of updates out of the box
39,1,1,im not sure if thats the case for everyone or just me you get used to it after a while it was in my backpack when the bus made an emergency break and screen got broken had to replace it myself not really a con but a bad luck and it cost to fix i wish it used usb type c port for charging not really sure about possibility of that tho no separate fan for gpu its not an absolute need but it would be a great addition there is an optical drive that extra space and weight would be great if used for something useful its not designed to be comfortable when using it with mouse you cant use one of the usb ports and the charging port is on the right side as well now the better part pros not heavy not ultraportable either tho great battery lifeprice is greatgreat everyday performancecan play every game i can throw at it in fhd with reduced graphics options except doom which needs very high framerates to be playable and mafia iii which has terrible optimization
17,0.64301471,0,customer service with acer is less than desirable
31,1,0,overall the lenovo ideapad really is a star laptop once i got over the initial shock that i was expecting an i processor as the former product listing had initially stated
23,0.996654119,0,battery life was initially about an hour less but with a few batches of updates now its about the same as with
17,0.999959426,0,every product line is bound to have a few defective units here and there get used to it and just send it back for another
30,0.991363491,0,there is a hazy yellow tint to the screen no matter the calibrations adjustments or any action taken
7,0.998639995,0,i cant speak for later models technical aspects pricepoint etc
17,0.991645642,0,hp and their support group couldnt care less
28,0.999999999,0,i purchased the extra ramkingston technology gb mhz ddrl pc v non ecc cl sodimm intel laptop memory kvrlsand a ssd to boost the performancesamsung evo gb inch sata iii internal ssd mz ebam
15,0.995928084,0,nothing like to chromebook i received last year
32,0.998923732,0,a second reset gave me a blue screen of death so i shipped it back to amazon
25,0.607194026,0,this unit appears to have the same coating on the screen that makes touch a drag
39,0.951820316,0,again maybe a driver thing but thats not an excuse
21,1,1,performance it would be nice to have skylake or even broadwell under the hood for what it retails for i wouldnt pay retail or even close to it for this setup nm vs nm physical footprint should see about an hour increase in battery life yada yada but for my purposes no significant difference other than the psychological win
15,0.999521943,0,they havent changed since last year either
32,0.970156152,0,btw it ran for hours and hours last night i checked it i still had over minutes
14,0.999999914,0,all i know is i cant update my internal wifi drivers because it crashes the system and my usb wifi dongle cant be updated either for the same reason
23,0.947012763,0,but this computer will last years i would assume if you take care of it
18,1,1,might have to look in the instructions or online sites that require java wont work but luckily java is slowly going away i realize youre supposed to store everything in the cloud but it would be nice if they replace the gb ssd with a gb ssd and bumped the price up by only two usb ports and they are instead of
16,0.999998551,0,months later when i went to close the laptop and instead of the hinge bending all pressure was put onto the screen and it bent the screen causing the moniter to split in half
32,0.463186879,0,starting it up takes less than secs to boot into system
17,0.979711974,0,this will be an issue when the battery needs to be replaced in the future which if you keep the computer for several years is probably going to happen
8,0.997883625,0,the computer also regularly crawls to a stop and is unusable
17,0.999407015,0,ive contacted samsung and got a service request in for a laptop that ive had in my possession for less than hours
18,1,0,second when i asked the technical support representative to recommend an adapter that would work he claimed that the adapter that was used to test the tb on dual k monitors was an apple usb c digital av multiport adapter
9,0.96922585,0,for a laptop of k usd i cant believe ive had these issues with less than a month of usage
0,0.994019789,0,i like the fingers drag on mac but i cant find the driver on sb to do the same
17,0.999982547,0,if you do happen to update your wlan driver later and the speed dies and you know exactly what you did it can be reversed by rolling back the driver in device manager
39,0.994542186,1,really gets me mad because i just wasted bucks on an gb memory card hopefully this will improve some of the slowness
13,0.999999979,1,it would be nice if it attached to the right side for drawing purposes when i flip the display around
23,0.999628095,0,the battery can last upwards of eight hours with those operating conditions
23,0.99833613,0,this chromebook is at the one year mark and after semi regular use the battery will no longer charge
38,0.99999938,1,in the future it would be nice if lenovo used a driver that allows for this kind of customization from within the windows settings like the surface line
6,0.995378392,1,if i put in the equivalent offers from prostar it would be upwards and perhaps low s or high s if i knew to not have the inferior parts not installed
15,0.882626548,0,this model has had no issues like the last one
31,0.920293226,0,i left off the last star because of price
17,0.999702985,0,we were on the phone with tech support from acer for a few hours after two days we had to ship it back to acer
33,1,1,the only thing i really hate about it is it does not have an ethernet cord plug outlet it only runs on wifi and sometimes you go places such as school sites that have wifi passwords and it would be nice to just be able to plug the computer in or else you dont have access
28,0.999969925,0,you can still use it with windows but linux is where this computer shines core intel ssd gb of memory for less than and not a chromebook
32,0.94939444,0,a half hour later i was still getting those messages
4,0.9778546,0,but i do not think less power consumption gains anything noticeable on laptop
19,0.999999971,1,it would be great for your granny or a small child maybe if they never need to do anything other than use email browse the internet and goof off on youtube
15,0.994958729,0,my last one was back in the time of vista when acer was doing a clam shell type design
30,0.999999998,1,it would be a great laptop if it wasnt for the fact that it literally does not have the ability to display the color yellow comes through as more of a dark mustard and the fact that the hinge is a ticking time bomb
39,0.95979595,0,if it were not for the missing parts i would give this laptop five stars
19,0.977765337,0,he can get on social media and do schoolwork on it drive just doesnt capitalize for him so i give it stars
23,0.999979236,0,this chromebook is lightweight and has a battery that seems to last forever
25,0.98145957,0,in less than a year the charging port broke on this product
0,0.777419485,0,this pc replaces an hpcompaq laptop that ive used every day for the last years
33,1,0,this means that i take my laptop to the public library where i download the return label information to the library system and then use the library printer to print out the return label
6,0.999819024,0,two reasons why it has one less star than the sd slot on the side does not insert all the way in
15,0.74434069,0,didnt even last years
8,0.999246547,0,not send you to a regular computer to add a cloud printer
30,0.999999995,0,after losing my grip on my computer a few weeks ago it slid less than a foot from my hand to the floor being on the edge of my bed and landed on the power cord still plugged into the computer
15,0.998480697,0,i purchased this laptop less than a year ago and its already failing as a computer
25,0.997239313,0,i bought my lenovo yoga last august and it has been returned to the manufacturer twice for an internal power supply problem
2,0.974553951,0,i used a custom version of windows to run faster and use less drive space
15,0.435273019,0,it does last few hours
23,0.999998131,0,a charge will last about hours unless youre gaming and the laptop charges in about an hour
2,0.953786179,0,also space is an issue but an external or extra internal drive fixes that
23,0.999996631,0,if you try to play video games or use even medium brightness your battery will literally last hours
15,0.999010903,0,also i had laptops in last years from dell inspiron and lattitude and batteries on both laptops died after about year
7,0.999998812,0,for instance while ive been typing this review it froze up but i kept typing and about seconds later it caught up with what i had typed several times now in less than minutes
4,0.52181751,0,this notebook was refurbished and not even the same computer internally
39,0.994933827,1,even though there is a slight noise in my computers radiator i would like also to give it stars
16,0.999999925,0,turn the laptop around hit the outside screen switch and i have a tablet at the angle i want and can watch movies or still just use the tablet as it was meant to be used
7,0.993869989,0,i owned a previous dell from back when windows xp was a powerhouse
32,0.626214052,0,the computer stopped working less than a year
17,0.50212436,0,nothing missing from this computer
0,0.858761606,0,we got this as a second laptop for the household when two people want to get on the computer at the same time
16,0.999999999,0,a few hours after the rep had left i had reason to put the pc in the tent mode to watch a movie and discovered the screen image no longer would rotate degrees when the unit was flipped
33,0.72929482,0,microsoft office is a big absence from the chromebook ecosystem
23,0.999920218,0,also the battery life can easily last around hours
23,0.999492322,0,the battery life is a big pro because it last hours
39,0.999984558,0,just something to keep in mind you can get an jump drive for less than twenty bucks that will double your storage space all while taking up just an inch or two of space in your laptop bag
25,0.826070896,0,the screen went out less than days of owning it
15,0.99997751,0,i had bought this laptop from the ibuypower website around the summer to fall of last year
25,0.970045708,0,when i researched this item no one said chromebooks had issues linking to wifi on public servers
39,0.999851432,1,it would be nice if it was backlit but hopefully that will come in future iterations of the toshiba chromebook
15,0.983657664,0,its the last computer i buy from dell after years of buying their computers and monitors
4,0.991390354,0,and now that the price is less than gb the upgrade is a no brainer
0,0.999962906,0,we have restored the computer multiple times and changed a few things here and there but lenovo has done something to their computers that you can not make your changes permanent
30,0.435721319,0,less than two months since buying the screen went out
23,0.899609674,0,the battery last a lot longer
32,0.605328455,0,my last outing without the safety of house electricity time out at hours hum lost an hour
25,0.999870407,0,after buying asus computers from amazon that stopped working less than months after purchasing seems to be a recurrent problem on their reviews
30,0.853581941,0,and it just went out after less than a year wont power on
14,0.999828236,0,a conversion adapter micro usb to usb is included so usb items can still be used as with a regular notebook
16,0.999710697,0,however i will have to post battery life with the tb wd blue since it is a less power hungry drive
4,0.999385295,0,overall i spend extra dollar on this computer where i should not have
33,0.901628749,1,it is marketed to students but i think many users would like this computer
17,0.946793276,0,one and a half years after buying it from one day to the next it just never turned on again
32,0.985681234,0,then last night my wife was watching a video on it and the screen just displayed digital lines everywhere see attachment
33,0.999997595,1,i dont print a lot so not a big negative and there are workarounds but it would be nice to just be able to hook up any printer
23,0.838361446,0,faster speed and the the battery last longer
32,0.782506762,0,after it got stolen a few years later i went back to being a pc user with an hp

7,0.998498948,0,in less than three months ive had to reinstall the wireless drive five times
7,0.999829226,0,my last computer was a compaq notebook running windows xp and thank the lord it is still running
25,0.999998308,0,if you have never bought a laptop overseas this machine has an international warranty and seems to have been targeted to a variety of countries you might find the partitioning strange
39,0.853858857,1,it would be really nice to have a product that works out of the box
33,0.812409294,1,it would be nice to have my iphoto and itunes library on it but theres just no room
28,0.996380467,0,when the battery shows less than it can backup data automatically so you wont lose it
3,0.999939377,0,dropoff at fedex fedex picks up and begins shipment to dell followup w dell support and am told this is on standard instead of express as previously notified
9,0.999901643,0,after about an hour of troubleshooting my boyfriend figured out that the network adapter driver was not installed during setup and was missing
4,0.99749006,0,this is overall a very solid pc for the price i paid under k
15,0.512322199,0,ive had less than a year and ive already reinstalled windows twice
23,0.809557516,0,if this machine is gon na last me for two years i will be in heaven
15,0.999605653,0,our kids break computers so when the they killed off our last laptop we bought one of these for them to do homework
21,1,1,performance it would be nice to have skylake or even broadwell under the hood for what it retails for i wouldnt pay retail or even close to it for this setup nm vs nm physical footprint should see about an hour increase in battery life yada yada but for my purposes no significant difference other than the psychological win
23,0.999431448,0,the battery should last all day hours on a charge

32,0.999979809,0,well after that the flickering stopped until few hours later when the the flickering started all over again
15,0.999856759,0,i bought this computer hoping that it would last me for a while its not even a year as yet i wasnt using it for two weeks
19,0.999999999,0,if you looking for a laptop with a touch screen for doing online activities email web searches word processing social media etc
4,0.999616378,0,overall this laptop is what you would expect to perform when you have reviewed its specifications and is definitely worth its price
25,0.999999804,0,they then called back and said that this was not covered under warranty because it was caused by physical damage
39,0.999882037,1,september seems like it would be great if it didnt come with a broken screeni was really excited for my new asus chromebook
18,1,1,might have to look in the instructions or online sites that require java wont work but luckily java is slowly going away i realize youre supposed to store everything in the cloud but it would be nice if they replace the gb ssd with a gb ssd and bumped the price up by only two usb ports and they are instead of
39,0.992299918,0,never buy a computer with less than gb of ram unless you dont plan to use an internet browser
2,0.999505583,0,i removed the regular inch drive and use it for backup and external storage
39,0.944028879,0,that means hopefully there wont be a keyboard wearing indentation in the screen like there was from my last chromebook
23,0.891526422,0,i installed lightroom last night
0,0.999998451,0,i went for this machine to get away from the weight of my regular laptop computer but i cant say i feel it is money well spent
39,0.999940521,0,the backlit keyboard the p display and the overall solid if plastic build make this feel like a machine
0,0.998695583,0,the touch pad brings me back to the home windows screen occasionally when i am working and i still dont understand what move would prompt that response
19,0.265465466,0,but what matters is that the computer starts in less than seconds or perhaps less
0,0.741999415,0,lastly is the size
27,0.999617087,0,i ended up getting office and this laptop for less than dollars tax included
8,0.968861834,0,also the web browser that comes with it is not internet explorer like your regular windows computer
5,1,0,well not quite it loaded to a white screen that said chrome os is missing or damaged and said to visit a specific url to start the recovery process
32,0.999999849,0,the second item began showing signs of malfunctioning within an hour operations freezing keyboard not responding strange flickering of a webpage etc
4,0.999741896,0,i upgraded the ram to gb and got a generic usb dvdcd rw and shes in business for less than bucks
14,0.999999998,0,several users have reported the flicker not just happen with the laptop screen but with external monitors through hdmi output port that confirms the hardware issues on the motherboard circuit
33,0.999999986,0,while there are several limits on what you can do with the chromebook without wifi there are still offline apps that can be used like your google drive google docs and a few others
25,0.999561129,0,the computer also acts strangely with the charger plugged in doing things like minimizing the window to a x inch mini in the middle of the screen with no warning or explanation
19,1,1,updated on dec although i am happy with the purchase of this computer i would like amazon to please note that i did not get the correct color
39,0.998897057,1,hey im in love with hp products i have an hp laptop now i have a very large following on fb instagram youtube i would love to do a review on this product
17,0.999694731,0,if there is something less than one star i will give it to asus because of the missed up support line
17,0.958265402,0,returned the unit to amazon after having it in the house less than hours
15,0.931050955,0,my last laptop had maybe hours and took seconds to compile anything while this one is snappier
1,0.999748808,0,has the big screen plenty of cpu power for browsing the net but not for gamers
39,0.999668199,1,i wish all computers were built like this were the bottom slides off for easy access to internal parts no screws
17,0.999303306,0,it locked after the days warranty therefore when i sent it back the money returned was less than what i paid for
15,0.997405512,0,when my previous sony laptop would no longer charge its battery after three years i ordered a lenovo laptop which seemed to have what i wanted but i had to send it back and ordered this acer aspire
0,0.99846334,0,i cant see any difference than a regular size keyboard
15,0.998565602,0,as a last ditch effort i went back to hp support website where you can type the model and hp will find your computer
39,0.998333171,1,in years i hope acer has an equivalent device as ill definitively buy from them if thats the case
16,0.999127298,0,next is holding down the power button for seconds to power off then pressing for another seconds to turn back on
4,0.99999996,0,i think some sort of biometric device is a necessity nowadays lastly i would think that a laptop geared towards power users or business folks would come with windows pro instead of the home edition
8,0.999998506,0,speed portable realiable everything u need if u wan na stay socailly connected business oriented and just overall satisfaction
15,0.930969343,0,ive ordered quite a few of these for my employees over the last years and they are workhorses
0,0.999391136,0,the overall size of this is about the same as a sheet letter size spiral notebook but just a touch thicker
9,0.999090645,0,even if they do not continue with the cloud storage you can get an external drive for less than
17,0.997720724,0,i even paid for expedited international shipping thinking the product would actually work
0,0.676050964,0,for example i cant search back into last years events to find out the last time i went to the dentist
13,0.999994553,0,i was always worried about it coming up missing after going through airport security the thieves in the tsa
15,0.780886858,0,i have had it for maybe less than a year
32,0.838283525,0,multiple issues include the display in less than a year of ownership
0,0.999995251,0,i couldnt even use ms word which you have to buy of course god forbid they actually make something like that standard on all computers nowadays
15,0.983054849,0,i cant wait till they figure out how to make batteries last longer
39,0.999999783,1,it would be great if they could add the magnifying feature from android where you click on something and if it isnt sure what you meant it will enlarge the area so you can more easily tap what you want
15,0.999936028,0,the th gen wasnt even around last year so this is a big deal
15,0.996841676,0,so if you want to spend on a computer that may last a year then go for it
17,0.234267289,0,i tried again hours later same thing
17,0.996853675,0,still missing netflix and audio blue tooth support which could trigger my return of the unit if not forthcoming
15,0.959650418,0,this is the last straw do not buy this product
6,0.998813797,1,zero bloatware here is a trend that i hope many other manufacturers follow
15,0.9991607,0,a few months ago it started crashing and since i got a gift card used it towards a tcb last month
32,0.478426904,0,lasts all day and charges in less than two hours
15,0.987504873,0,i bought this laptop last year
15,0.997850824,0,have been using this computer exclusively for almost the last six months
16,0.99992014,0,so then i pressed on the power button for a few seconds until it shut down and i powered it back up and the screen came back to life
15,0.219000701,0,two drives of less than that
17,0.545760323,0,i attempted on several networks with the same results to rule out wireless modems
5,0.999999984,0,this is a big deal for me so i reinstalled the laptop with a copy of windows re partitioned the hdd during the process minus the recovery partition and then upgraded back to windows
16,0.784827935,0,left it on for several hours to ensure it wouldnt shut itself down again
19,0.999931464,0,it last for hours on end if your just doing regular things on it like watching youtube or typing a paper
9,0.999120259,0,probably will be one of the last to upgrade to windows even though hp sent me a disk for it
30,0.919191953,0,we dont even use ours anymore and weve had them less than a year
22,0.999999991,0,the two extensions involved add to feedly and tweet this page each had less than users but these users started to experience unwanted ads and complain about this upon support forums according to the wall street journal
19,0.999743237,0,i am doing some programming a bit video editing some regular use like surfing on it and you know what
17,0.998997158,0,i was going to throw it in the garbage wasnt worth the price of shipping it back
35,0.999999975,0,i was looking for a model that was so smalllight that i wouldnt have to think twice about whether i wanted to drag it along in my bag
39,0.589022614,0,perhaps it is less glossy than some but i can still use it as a mirror when the screen is off
25,0.997589206,0,i am outside my window to return to amazon so i have been trying to deal with asus warranty department
4,0.992236326,0,overall though its a solid computer for the price point
15,0.983442898,0,i also have not seen overheating on this yet unlike the gs that i tried last year
28,0.999998038,0,with the series chromebook there are no moving parts meaning there is less parts that can break generate heat or consume electricity
25,0.989226066,0,lastly i did not buy the extended warranty bought it times before on the hps and used it once
17,0.996597224,0,i replaced the driver from the website several ties and it still has the same issue
25,0.999993994,0,im quickly starting the process to get asus to cover the repairs before my warranty is up in a month just so i can have something to get me through the last few months of college
25,0.994061712,0,after owning the laptop for less than hours and spending over dollars i am having conversations with customer service
13,0.988570563,0,lastly i wish it would be easier to import my music from my itunes library
23,0.999972013,0,it is extra lightweight comes on immediately and battery life last all day about hours
15,0.539292715,0,we have had this less than year and it no longer works
7,0.999999963,0,the design of the notebook allows the keyboard section to tilt at an angle for ease of typing i believe this design makes it less stressful on my wrists and hands as i type
15,0.999999726,0,before we start do keep in mind that this is the second dell chromebook dell released one last year and now released this one with the same name
0,0.999836523,0,lastly any moistness whatsoever on the touchpad or the touchscreen will make the computer go haywire
30,0.9999865,0,at this point bluetooth wireless speakers and trackpad dont work less than a year after purchase
2,0.999999606,0,it did work well to connect to my dslr via usb to back images up to my external drive though a slight con regarding this mentioned later
15,0.999998739,0,i started using chromebooks a year and a half ago for online school and have never looked back
17,0.999999998,0,after several minutes the technician told me that my graphics card was not fitted properly in and that this was actually a hardware issue and i would need to send back the laptop
7,0.99828247,0,less than three months after purchase number keys stopped working so we cant even sign in
19,0.999999649,0,if youre like me and of the time you spend on a computer is spent on social media and internet browsing then a chromebook cant be beat
0,0.999984141,0,i had everything in pieces so it was much easier to do this but taking everything apart would be much harder to put back together
39,0.996209687,0,suspected less battery time but apple offered months warrenty wo asking and not to mention complinetry g making machine g at price of g hdd
17,0.995829147,0,few minutes later found phone number online
17,0.997776119,0,now i am stuck with this laptop as amazon support window closed days back
39,0.999998231,1,i wish the screen quality was a little better but overall not too bad
38,0.967857122,0,for the last ten years my experience has been with ms based servers and workstations
17,0.999980282,0,now i have to deal with this issue outside of amazon as i just got back in the country on july st and the support ran out the next day
2,0.999999112,0,just plugged in says chrome is missing or damaged please insert a recovery usb stick or sd card
23,0.999977445,0,battery seems to last unplugged around hours
39,0.961874415,1,it would be nice if dell explained the problem its cause and possible solutions
15,0.759495664,0,based on the specs this thing is no less than dollars overpriced
39,0.707998338,1,another thing it would be nice to be able to play dvds on this dell with f windows computer
39,0.999999953,1,the new aspire is great much faster thanks to the improved hard drive and with gigabytes of ram hopefully it will hold up for another years
19,0.999999315,0,i got this computer so i could do a few basic things social media do my taxes online watch netflix
25,0.393772051,0,i have asus products and have not had a problem over the last years
0,0.998190478,0,i was looking for a or less inch touchscreen just to take with me when im out and about
23,0.999915189,0,the ca is a big upgrade in terms of speed and screen quality plus the battery last a bit longer too
23,0.989437258,0,then months later same thing it froze up and they said it was something with the battery
18,0.971367838,0,unlike actual mechanical drives these guys are digital and store information digitally
19,0.999978126,0,tv and netflix without crashing or a lot of buffering which i cant say about my last computer that i had for years before replacing it with this
17,0.788011764,0,it took me probably less than minutes to get accustomed to the size of the keyboard and where the keys are
0,0.519334344,0,this is not a regular laptop that you can load up office products and use
0,0.994121939,0,i dont use the second screen as much but it is useful if you like having a touch screen and are torn between a tablet and a laptop
7,0.563702756,0,not a computer geek so cant give the technical feed back
23,0.964434244,0,cons battery life is less than they claimed
17,0.999999828,0,their forums at the time i called in had a page post of complaints about this component being missing and when i called in their tech support still didnt believe that mine was missing
10,1,1,this computer hopefully now that jobs is gone who knows what the quality is really like my iphone has been a disappointment recently will hopefully last me another years
23,0.964434244,0,that means it has less battery life
30,0.985978568,0,less memory than my phone has and battery lasted a year
23,0.994426449,0,so if i was gaming the battery would last even less time
32,0.993954737,0,the time is now pm the following day hours later and the computer is still updating
30,0.999775168,0,normally as a last ditch effort i would disconnect the power cord and remove the battery
17,0.976967083,0,nothing i did showed the laptop having any life left in it and after fiddling with it for a few days decided to use it for parts
7,0.999999956,0,if you setup the way i stated less the nd video card you will have the fastest computer made that includes any tower motherboard type computers bar none
23,0.999605799,0,pros battery life last all day
32,0.468420328,0,set it up and encrypted in less than an hour
4,0.984271373,0,subsequent users can be added and deleted but not the owner
17,0.999986356,0,subsequently it was left by the service center even though the error code showed back up seconds after windows re installed the driver
3,0.964043962,0,got dual booted with ubuntu linux to run regular programs
1,1,0,lasts hours of web browsing and doesnt throw any heat probably less heat than what a tablet would throw and it can run counter strike global offensive without a glitch
4,0.997929465,0,overall if you have the extra cash get the gb ram model
23,0.998778301,0,hour battery life and charges in two hours or less
4,0.748048431,0,it is about feet lastly the price
25,0.999293981,1,please samsung i hope this product continues its strong start
23,0.995810434,0,that being said who knows maybe a non removeable battery will be less prone to damage from spills
25,0.999979197,0,the tech rep arrived a few day later swapped out the motherboard power port and exchanged the ac cable and adapter
19,0.994741637,0,watching videos and browsing reddit and stuff like that it will last it hours
17,0.695457882,0,properly maintained it might last years
15,0.999189678,1,i would not purchase an acer again because it only lasted one year i hope i get longer out of this one
32,0.997059569,0,edit after an initial rating of stars i am reducing it after a year and a half
39,1,1,system stats milled aluminum case i u ghz processor gb ram operating system built in touchpad and bluetooth connectivity speakers comes with windows sd slot hd video slot usb slots pros very light weight responsive touchpad great sound nice screen resolution cons it would be nice to have been slightly larger so as to have dvd drive theres a lot of power in this little package
15,0.777566446,0,it didnt last for two years
23,0.887145187,0,battery does not last hours
23,0.440138168,0,this one last for a couple of hours even at max load
23,0.916395135,0,my last bit of review regards the video card
25,0.940352578,0,battery malfunctioned after days just outside of return period
9,0.9999966,0,however its not a regular computer so dont expect to install games photoshop be a power user or write any codeprogram because you cant do that on it
0,1,0,the touchscreen is a mess and i dont even use the touchscreen havent from the beginning since the keyboard functionality would not work if i used the touchscreen for any extended period of time say ten minutes
0,0.999903879,0,this laptop can barely run word let alone process a touch screen and multiple screens desktops
15,0.998926955,0,next tablet i buy will be based on the quality of its battery to recharge properly over say yrs
28,0.999980167,0,its powered by last years intel n celeron processor at ghz and has gigabytes of ram and gigabytes of on board storage
0,0.995499747,0,its weight and size inch screen is a lot easier on your back than a or inch laptop with a solid metal case
24,1,1,right now i dont have a lot of confidence in it ever working i bought what i thought would be a new notebook but it seems to me after all the problems that we have had to endure that it is not new but abused
16,0.998799095,0,when you actually look at them side by side with a field of white on the screen the acer looks really blue
15,0.911996217,1,google issues with the ideapad and all lenovo products i wish i had before i made this mistake
32,0.998881477,0,i gave stars because ive had it for less than a month and the screen cracked while it was in a laptop sleeve in my backpack
16,0.999999989,0,lower left corner of screen isnt glued properly so it doesnt sit flush with the case
32,0.999715821,0,last week the second asus came home with a cracked screen
39,0.999996565,1,the pascal architecture gives the performance jump to buy a good machine form many year it would be nice to have a stronger cpu processor but that means more cost to an allready expensive machine
23,0.99925924,0,also i find that i regularly get hours of battery life taking notes browsing etc
23,0.997132877,0,battery last forever for me
15,0.929707042,0,a computer should last longer than a year
32,0.999492283,0,blue screen of death multiple times per day
0,0.461112566,0,i have used a regular asus for years
17,0.872622403,0,after a few days of testing installing all of my programs and pushing the graphics card to the limits i have made several conclusions regarding this laptop
23,0.641387014,0,also the charging port seems less flimsy
0,0.995165284,0,to summarize i dont want a touchscreen when typing and doing emails and regular laptop functions
7,0.998476715,0,my last advice stay away from this brand
15,0.98827219,0,knowing what i know now i just bought my last acer product
33,0.999991432,1,it would be nice if it connected to my home wi fi but i have to take it down to the public library to use it
17,0.990280088,0,the laptop came with hardware and software issues and the replacement sent back also had the same issues
7,0.999729554,0,and im hoping that in the future revised specs for computer peripherals will be timely disclosed to peripherals manufacturers and end users aka the public so we have fully functioning computers and peripherals at the time of purchase
27,0.99984087,0,once a few programs are running and every time you click you have to wait several seconds before anything happens at all
15,0.999047863,0,why pay for almost for a computer when it cant even last a year
19,0.999999952,1,all that said for the price this is a good machine that will let you surf the web check your email run some programs and hopefully last a few years before something fizzles out
7,0.991266631,0,boots up in under seconds and all programs including ms word are running within seconds or less
6,1,0,reasons not working not properly working camera the camera is not recognized by any pre installed software skype camera standard windows application tridef smartcam preinstalled camera utility it is not found by system at all no camera in device manager
16,0.999996525,0,i shut it down removed the bottom cover and disconnected the internal battery and power waited a few minutes reconnected everything and powered the system back up
0,0.989615948,0,this one was a step back in almost every way that counts the previous one was touch screen this one was not
32,0.999997669,0,updated review after using this for about months im lowering my rating from the initial stars to i wisht they had stars when i move the screen back and forth it blue screens or external monitors disconnect
39,0.999670464,1,i wish the screen was touch capable as advertised just for my kids to be able to draw on
32,0.931306945,0,outside screen worked for about a week
15,0.934204701,0,my last computer was a hp envy
1,0.993495793,0,i also tried a few games running locally including pacman dx luftrausers and towerfall ascension
15,0.901265113,0,purchased and received this computer is being returned less than one month after purchase
15,0.93776951,0,i bought this computer last week
33,0.999998823,1,it would be to great to have the wifi embedded so i can get online anywhere and not be dependent on my home wifi or a cafe connection
25,0.733739686,0,i spoke to the warranty company who said since it was less than days to follow amazons advise
24,1,1,right now i dont have a lot of confidence in it ever working i bought what i thought would be a new notebook but it seems to me after all the problems that we have had to endure that it is not new but abused
5,0.999969553,0,ive looked at the diagram several times i think they sent a minor incorrect cord or its just missing
2,0.999998172,0,less connectivity options as just an hdmi connector usbs and an sd card reader
17,0.998611441,0,i called acer support and the guy i spoke with seemed to know less about computers than i do
32,0.931556797,0,encountered some internal issue gave me a blue screen and never turned on again
31,0.997228558,0,may be selling defective products with less price
39,0.994159358,1,it would be nice to know the reason for the screen to change like it did
15,0.997496759,0,last year about this time i picked up an acer chromebook for
0,0.999983121,0,the casing is lightweight and while typing the screen actually jiggles back and forth a bit
17,0.999998612,0,the last time i had to contact dell support and actually ended up re installing windows
3,0.999996186,0,i got the same thing here minus gb of ram and the disconnect ability of the undocking mode for almost k less
39,0.999564438,1,maybe not a common need but annoying for how basic a task this is screen size i would like about one more inch
32,0.445055721,0,i have had it less than a year and this morning it fried on me
32,0.99975579,0,after plugging it up and going through a few prelims the screen went blank and would not return
15,0.615416122,0,this is probably the last model surviving
17,0.893023768,0,then less than an hour to install all the microsoft updates
39,0.99998354,0,the wireless card worked excellently it actually made me jump back a bit when it just worked without hesitation with ac and bluetooth functionality included
39,0.999714658,1,this is a wonderful laptop although it would be nice if accessories like a second power supply were easier to get
15,0.699214474,0,quit working and in the trash less than a year from purchase
0,0.97623516,0,i have never had a screen break on me and my computers usually last years not months
16,0.999798344,0,less than three months and my screen is now at an angle since the hinge doesnt support it correctly
8,0.999999279,0,the webcam did not work so i upgraded windows then i lost internet connectivity and i had to go back to a previous version of windows
33,0.999553822,1,it would be so nice to use my computer without feeling like throwing it through the window
15,0.999530916,0,bought this for my daughter for christmas last year and now it wont charge
19,0.999999998,0,im not a very technical person to let you know how it performs but it does what i need it to which is surf store pics listen to music develop power points for work etc
14,1,1,i wish the screen hinge had more range of motion and it needs a keyboard lightbacklight other than that and the fact that win blows works perfectly
39,0.537452313,0,i can even take it outside on my deck under a gazebo and see the screen without any problems
0,0.968659592,0,for the price of a chromebook it certainly is not a big risk to try and you can use it as a second computer
39,0.935297107,1,also it would be nice if the laptop was a little slimmer lbs
17,0.999999998,0,after another hour on the phone with customer service they informed me that it had to be sent back to the us repair center
25,0.999774918,1,their customer service is as poor as their quality and if you do get this computer i hope your luck was much better than ours
9,0.63452271,0,i have the db server installed and i regularly have instances of vs running simultaneously
5,0.999999994,0,you may need to restart the pc once without the hdd in the second slot once it is cloned then shut down and reinstall the hdd to the second bay
23,0.996859553,0,i would guess because i havent tested that the battery would last to hours
16,0.726030321,0,battery life is now about double what i had previously
30,1,0,i had the machine under warranty so both were replaced battery rapidly held less and less charge at this point if i pull the ac plug the computer immediately turns off every time the computer wakes from sleep the trackpad disappears from the device manager
15,0.942226437,0,while prices of both models are relatively the same around for i and for i versions as of march on amazon there are several differences
23,0.765265956,0,i dont see how this will last once the years are up
39,0.987041107,1,i wish the screen was better but what do you expect from a chromebook that costs less than
32,0.983403637,0,we began having problems with the charging port on this computer less than a month after purchase
38,0.999814788,0,asuss way of giving apples retina display the big middle finger
39,0.543606233,1,it would be nice if the documentation pointed that out
4,0.999552287,0,saving today isnt worth having to replace it a year later
27,0.227191141,0,it subsequently powers off after seconds
0,0.939656013,0,the touch screen is less responsive than competitors
32,0.992481827,0,i have had this tablet laptop for less than a month and the touch screen has stopped working twice
16,0.999919869,0,the unit also features an unoccupied msata mini half height slot and a standard mm ssd leaving lots of options for disc upgrades
14,0.999995646,0,you could run a third extra screen by plugging it into the hdmi or vga port on the laptop
25,0.980621563,0,the laptop has some scratches on the outside but none that werent already in the description
23,0.918865148,0,i just want to say that i had the same update applied in less than an hour
8,0.999804416,0,resolving that problem and obtaining printer drivers that worked required several hours of professional attention
0,0.914470506,0,i had to spend several hours figuring out how to use windows but it was worth it because of the screen
15,0.954864413,0,i got this last christmas and less than a year later it started to fall apart
17,0.99999984,0,the operating system crashed after just over a month outside return window and the fix found online didnt work
23,0.999980662,0,but when we tried to charge it for the second time we couldnt get the plug into the laptop it started smoking and realized the plastic blue coating had melted into the charging port
16,0.999968148,0,seems to have a slightly shorter life than my acer c which literally went for days but probably because of the aforementioned dozens of tabs and netflix
15,0.965299233,0,in years as an it professional i have never had a laptop last me for less that three years
2,0.99999966,0,i was also worried about getting a chromebook because of the limited internal storage inability to download programs and relative uselessness when not connected to the internet
39,0.999999986,1,touchpads have gotten much better and are almost universally glass compared to the crappy plastic ones of days past and screens have massively improved over the past two years hopefully crappy tn panel x screens will be a thing of the past soon they overstayed their welcome for far too long and pc manufacturers gypped consumers with them for too long but these windows issues are still here and sadly might always be

39,1,1,i know i replied to this message weeks ago but i have not received any help so far the manufacturer seems to think that its your problem and the people of your and say i have to deal with the manufacturer who wants me to send it to texas because the screen is set to its minimal brightness so its impossible to configure the computer unless i can configure it i can not actually change the screen brightness because the function keys do not work unless they are attached to windows ive tried everything i can to fix it so if you could give me some advice on sending it back to you or perhaps you sending me another one so i have a box to send it back in that would be great because i just got back from vacation and i have to review this machine to see if were going to buy a hundred of them for a company but the moment its starting to look like were not going to bother because they dont have tech support but i do on this one and i would like it to work so if you can sort something out that would be great and if you can at least grant me the decency of a reply thank you very much

39,0.9997114,0,its so portable because of the size and openingclosing to life that id just throw it in my leather work bag or purse and scratched the outside a tad
0,0,1,my only con about the backlit which is nowhere near a dealbreaker is the keys get alittle hot from the light or the heat fan im not surethe fan is quiet and its in the back so it wont burn you the only time it gets hot is when your in high power mode playing a game using nvidia graphics but using the intel graphics you wont feel the heat at allwith the intel graphics my games are alittle laggy but its intel so its much better than older graphics but can still max out some games with only little stutters of lagthe screen viewing angles are great you can see from every angle with no glare due to its ips screenthe back logo lights up which is cool eyecandythe keys arent slippery there nice so when i type fast i have no problem and my fingers dont slide on to other keysif i was to be nitpicky the only thing id probably complain about is i just wish this had one more usb slot but thats nothing serious you can buy an external one and when you first have it its alittle slow and laggy because the isnt updated fully you just need to update win then that issue will go awayupdating to win is great but you must reinstall the atk package and other programs to make sure it works on windows asus face id doesnt work on windows just go to asus websiter put in your model and installlastly its an energy saver laptop which is great it saves eletrical powerthis pc is not heavy and would be great for travel the only issue is the subwofer its actually alittle bit bigger than what it looks like in the pic to carry that around with the asus is alittle annoying but the sound boost is worth it the hotspots on the pc are in vry great places so you dont get burned when using the pc its above the keyboard which is a great spot and the screen gets alittle hot but the only way the pc will get hot is if you game on it so you wont be using touch for gaming so that eliminates that problemoverall this pc is amazing and you should buy it i highly recommend anyone to buy it this laptop is worth every penny just do your research contact the seller and make sure they are selling you whats in the desc and if it matches then buy it dont buy something used and expect everything to run like new being cheap will only end you up with a problem that you have to fix

39,1,1,i think my phones display looks way better than the laptop chrome os can be a bit confusing but it doesnt take too long to learn and get used to chrome os could use a little improvement no doubt it will definitely get better as time progresses a larger screen would be nice but would probably make it a bit more expensive you cant really store any local files considering the fact that it only has gb of storage
0,0.999904649,0,seemed to perform well but the buttons for the mouse were hollow and it was like it wasnt well made maybe a part was missing under the buttons

25,0.999586403,0,i assume a manufacturing issue as there is no external screen damage on the front or back of the lcd panel
25,0.978891385,0,now a year later the same issue happened again out of warranty this time
9,1,0,lastly if you do decide to get this notebook and upgrade it with an ssd drive remember that you must initialize the drive under windows disk management before windows or the notebook can see it
7,0.999996453,0,has a slightly stronger graphics card but its a pain to setup since a later update made it stop working
2,1,0,you are left with needing to use an sd card reader usb to add space so that windows can continue to try to update with an external drive
17,0.999868038,0,this was their last chance this computer is being returned and i am getting something from another manufacturer
32,0.434260431,0,had it less than a month and twice i had to do a powerwash on it
39,0.999966746,1,i wish the screen was a little larger with less bezel but thats a minor nit
17,0.998987423,0,just couldnt get used to the unfamiliarity of the programs which would not have been a problem except that i am dealing with several health issues all at the same time
20,1,1,since people generally give reviews right after they receive a product i think it would be great to give people an idea of how a product is running a month and a half into ownershipthe first thing i would like to mention is lag time
33,0.886540353,1,one it doesnt support itunes which is fine but it would be great if it did

32,0.999998957,0,update ive occasionally had an issue where i cant turn the computer back on using the power button
14,0.999998714,0,i dont know if its a result from me accidentally dropping it and breaking off the two usb ports i had an external hhd plugged in at the time on the left side
0,0.723102152,0,after the purchase i have found this computer for less at local office supply stores
4,0.82505899,0,i paid for touchscreen but its just a regular screen
34,0.999999998,0,my point is that the less than helpful bt functionality doesnt seem to be the fault of the hardware rather its a limitation of the os
0,0.999449719,0,consthere is no back lit keyboard which i have never actually had however i can see this being beneficial to any laptop user
5,0.999999999,0,i then tried to roll back to the previous system image within the gb recovery partition by pressing f when the system started
2,0.999993765,0,so for instance if you want to store your google play music and movies on your chromebook youre currently limited to the internal memory
25,0.648931835,0,after my warranty is over which is less than yr felt cheated on this
4,0.997702677,0,makes me wonder what else is missing going to pick another brand after this experience
23,0.984370888,0,unlike my regular laptop the zenbook seems to have an internal battery

15,0.99999928,0,you are going to say well i guess grandmas christmas jammies she knitted me last year could have gone in my checked suitcase on this leg of the trip
7,0.999587526,0,ive seen my brother in law sitting outside for hours without plugging it in
23,0.992310681,0,that way maybe the battery will last a while
5,0.999996763,0,i ordered one of these opened the cover and there was an error message on the screen chrome os is missing or damaged
17,0.988607963,0,he tried everything and the last try took it hours yes hours to finish and yet didnt work
33,0.911280097,0,but im not expecting missing part
32,0.640716678,0,last straw was when the micheadphone port stopped working
19,0.999999958,1,it would be great for students a second computer or for anyone who is just looking to have the ability to get online and access basic programs
23,0.999113982,0,also the battery can last over hours sometimes over hours depends
17,0.744765422,0,tf card for those outside the us
0,0.944888842,0,keyboard is about the same as the asus and this model isnt back lit
15,0.620772883,0,less than a year
25,0.998306122,0,i have owned this laptop for year and months which is just outside the warranty period
17,0.769977292,0,i played this at work on a hour shift when our ac went out in tx while its degrees outside
25,0.999999458,0,seems i had a month to return to amazon so no luck there less than hours and i received a reply email from asus customer service with a link to start the rma process
17,1,0,i then called back and spent minutes on the phone about minutes on hold w a tech who initially spent minutes trying to instruct me on where to find the hibernation setting in windows and eventually advising me i could resolve the problem by setting the computer to never go into sleep or hibernation mode after being turned on
0,0.986619656,0,it is a few people spamming pretending to be multiple people having this screen issue
32,0.908389166,0,i was up and running in two evenings and back to actual productive work on the second evening
15,0.976140641,0,im hoping this laptop will last me years
4,0.514181977,0,price should be less than
34,1,0,customer service is a joke barely speak english and troubleshoot from a piece of paper
7,0.978709873,0,now i noticed that the battery doesnt last anymore even when i charge it overnight
31,0.999925075,0,i just received this computer and have spent the last days removing disabling lenovo programs that interfere with my web browsing
4,0.995825829,1,i looked at the gb but for the price i would suggest getting the
15,0.931124618,0,the bestpurchase i made for gaming computers in the last years
11,1,1,it would also be helpful to have a distinct physical bar separating the a key from the caps lock reminding the user of unique key locationsnitpicking thoughts both the i and gtx stickers were unevenly placed mismatched angles compared to the keyboard ships with near gb on a recovery partition
17,0.999987287,0,whenever something breaks we call up dell technical support and their warranty services fix it next business day thats what we use
32,0.82186308,0,it arrived yesterday and i had it installed in less then minutes
23,0.948650996,0,well the last time mine did it it blinked the power led times and would not come up
32,0.999204051,0,the speakers will not work if you have had headphones plugged in since the last time you restarted and the graphics driver stops working about once a day
39,0.955367215,1,ya it would be nice to have that also be an ssd but with the gb ram in this i dont really mind it much at this point
15,0.658085244,0,the computer did not last days
39,0.999887864,1,it would be better partitioned to gb for windows so that you have the remaining gb for data but oh well that can be done if needed later
33,0.99998187,0,i still dislike the fact that you cant drag and drop a file from google drive to dropbox
0,0.999926542,0,my asus laptop isnt doing well with travel the frame isnt holding up well so i needed something else that will get me through my last couple semesters of class and then my internship

2,0.999999998,0,theres also a sd card storage slot which ive added a gb card to for extra local storage if i need it
19,0.999985399,1,i was traveling a lot so i figured it would be nice to have a prettylightweight laptop with a full keyboard that i could use to do emails basic web browsing and google docs
32,0.577614029,0,the white screen is strange and displays squares of multicolored pixels all over it
32,0.998072211,0,one of them would no longer turn on after less than a week of use maybe hours of screen time
15,0.78210733,0,i just purchased this laptop and its been out of the box for less than hours
28,0.887055611,0,no moving parts also means less to break
15,0.979937497,0,i have used the macbook air for the last three years as a middle school teacher
39,0.879162919,1,it seemed like it would be great if it had arrived in working order
34,0.999999865,0,again i spend over minutes filtering through departments with individuals who barely speak english and need to transfer me or put me on hold
1,0.722142647,0,lower power consumption and less heat than spinning harddrives
25,0.814703342,0,but after less than a year the hinge on the laptop broke
4,0.998181138,0,overall for the price this samsung chromebook is definitely worth it
23,0.999782754,0,i could last for hour while listening to music w earphones programming in visual studios
32,0.999996687,0,flies thru everything i throw at it months later i started getting a red line down the screen bummer and without getting the warranty im out of luck
39,0.999999868,1,x on a laptop is simply not good enough by s standards so hopefully we see some new higher resolution displays from apple in the next year
39,0.994362734,1,i probably wont upgrade memory any more but it would be nice to have the option
14,0.999999983,0,i have a cooling fan in one an external usb port hub in one and a mouse dongle in the third
9,0.988721104,0,i like that the network internet page tells me my data usage for the last days
23,0.999959384,0,once it is charged it will last for five or six hours without a re charge
15,0.904555034,0,the last windows computer i bought was back in
23,0.99999999,0,powers up in about seconds battery life is around hours depending on usage and i streamed a p hd moivie last night
30,0.99999988,0,barely months later i took it out to prepare for a presentation and it wont take a charge or power from the ac cord
39,0.871063782,1,i wish all computer problems were this easy to solve
23,0.969470704,0,i have to see if it last longer than a month before making an assessment of the product
15,0.913105164,0,i havent had any problems or computer errors at all i took off a star because this does not last hours on battery
23,0.999951384,0,it draws about w or less while in use with a charged battery compared to almost w from my custom gaming pc
4,0.99999916,0,then what brand chromebook then was it worth the extra for this toshiba over their gb standard res version
28,0.99965727,0,you can get a gb ssd the extra gigs of memory and the hdd caddy for easily less than combined if you shop around
32,0.960777566,0,i printed the label and left the package outside before i went to work the next morning
15,0.998887415,0,i received the gb model of the asus chromebook flip last week having pre ordered through another online retailer
17,0.999997169,0,again asus says i need to send it back and they promise to actually replace the computer and not just send me back the pos i was sold
23,0.999629757,0,as you can see in the product description the laptop is supposed to last up to hours on a charge
14,0.996237152,0,i installed a third party wireless router and configured internet services on the macbook in a few minutes
0,0.999631885,0,now with a separate speaker to lug around the compact size has much less value
17,0.999913299,0,he offered me expidited shipping on to send the computer back in for service on the same unit
32,0.50161182,0,boots to home screen in seconds or less
25,0.860626212,0,the directions are cryptic and the last frame asks you to change the bios but doesnt say what
15,0.999754749,0,i bought this last year on september th
17,0.997583764,0,amazon gave me the choice to order the same computer again or just get my money back
17,0.993917425,0,next the following shipment arrived with a defective battery
16,0.748932121,0,i can load up my computer from power off and be playing a biggame like dragons dogma in seconds probably less
25,0.999413733,0,i wont rehash all the technical stuff that is already stated in the description
15,0.999999759,0,in summary if you dont mind to spend for a computer that last one year go ahead and buy it you will be please
4,0.999070046,0,i couldnt get it anywhere else for the price outside of amazon
17,0.998377652,0,folks who dont know how to replace a driver might have to spend an extra at their local computer shop to get this cleaned up
15,0.999555194,0,this computer has lasted me over a year and a half now through the bushveld of southern africa during my fieldwork days and beyond
2,0.998730144,0,if you want to download external programs outside of google then it wont work
39,1,1,a denotes an attribute in the dells favor and a denotes an advantage to the t dell i vs asus t larger screen size vs both at x resolution roomier keyboard that is much easier to type on more flexible screen i wish i could tilt the t screen back another degrees more memory and is user upgradable more storage and is user upgradable much faster charging t uses microusb charger which is slow faster cpu pentium n vs atom z or the older z shorter battery life hours vs hours heavier especially in tablet form bulkier power supply and uses a pronged power cord worse build quality dell uses soft plastics and the finish scratches easily higher street price at time of this reviewall in all i really like the dell
15,0.994005595,0,the tablet introduction a few years ago killed the netbook market
15,0.999965886,0,i purchased this computer for my daughter this time last year for school
25,0.988107116,0,buy from lenovo and not a third party so you are actually supported
15,0.758952673,1,will purchase this model again hopefully these issues will get resolved
23,0.887145187,0,the battery last for about hours
23,0.999743412,0,though i would say my actual use time is about hours per day some times less
19,0.999956133,0,if you are a regular person like me you will spend hours going through through the help forums on lenovos web site
15,0.999744612,0,not one product i have bought from hp in the last years has worked as advertised
0,0.99423928,0,if you do not like the style of windows it still has the regular windows look to it as well for the desktop
17,0.999773454,0,it has been sent back to samsung twice to be fixed and has been returned usable for a few hours and then back to the same error message
2,1,0,perhaps they thought it is not going to make much difference but believe it or not chromebooks are quite useful to copy data from one place to another e g pictures from flash drives to external drives and movies from external drives to flash drives and a faster interface will be quite useful here
25,0.998814988,0,sounds like they are trying to drag it out until year warranty has lapsed
4,0.998786938,0,again my advice dont spend the money get another computer for less and with less problems
32,0.77582638,0,when i turn the computer on or wake it up from sleep it loads up in probably less than seconds
33,0.999999978,1,it would be great fro a year old but no one else that needs to work on anything for real
32,0.572042395,0,stopped working in less than a year
15,0.995278626,0,this thing didnt even last me a year the touchscreen barely made it three months
32,0.592617845,0,ive had to do a computer refreshreset twice already and ive had this computer less than weeks
16,0.935138922,0,on initial bootup the cpu is already running at every few seconds
32,0.999910566,0,well let me take that back i just went and opened up netflix to get the name of the missing driver and it is now working
32,0.756748585,0,i still have all of the hp laptops i have purchased over the last years they all still work
17,0.354758648,0,its still operative after two years even though its missing bits now
0,0.999589857,0,since it has a metal edge i am worried it will get caught on something and break the drive and or outside case
4,0.997144492,1,this model should come with a warning label do not purchase for any reason
4,0.999018261,0,pro vs regular the pro is faster and for an extra i wanted the extra speed
2,0.833429515,0,compared to my last pc updates powering on and opening programs are times faster
33,0.998167184,0,im going to try just a regular windows op system like im used to and not even try another chrome book
30,0.696039343,0,computer is acting up and screen is not functioning properly
32,0.786734691,0,keyboard and touchscreen already has problems less than one year using
2,0.999999997,0,after getting it i realized that didnt have a regular hdmi port and also didnt have a memory card reader
28,0.999958717,0,for lighter workloads and if you use the intel p state governor for dynamic cpu frequency adjustment that can be stretched to another hour or two
17,0.999999484,0,when i asked farat herman client technical support specialist why he could not track my laptops location at the warehouse his initial response was that it probably was re issued to another customer
23,0.955495281,1,hopefully battery issues will be addressed soon
17,0.94140486,0,sent it back they fixed it two months later the battery died again
15,0.999711078,0,my friend bought a pro last year and when i showed him this he thought it was an air
4,0.986055414,0,added another gb of ram in less than a couple of minutes
33,0.994071818,0,still need to get used to the chrome os missing programs and online apps
28,0.999948939,0,when the laptop was received from asus the solid state drive was there but the terabyte drive was not correctly configured and appeared to be missing
27,0.908022968,0,asus wants the price of the laptop to bring it back to life not worth it
25,0.998940813,0,what reassurance do i have if the notebook is repairedreplaced but the same problems reoccur but outside of the year warranty window
23,0.957318403,0,when gaming you get less than an hour
0,0.999999989,0,it has the macbook esque ability that allows you to immediately start using it from where you left off if you just closed the laptop lid instead of powering off i really like this feature and it doesnt waste battery or anything to do this
16,0.999999973,0,my mode of operation is to have my thumb on the left mouse button and my index finger doing the tracking but with this style of trackpad that tends to result in misclicks and slightly incorrect highlights
9,0.971810582,0,no issues encountered and i was back up and running in less than an hour on the samsung drive
17,0.999998973,0,if i had to go back to windows id get a dell with their gold premier whatever enhanced technical support and on site service
28,0.999575986,0,lastly it has a blu ray drive which i missed in the specs when i ordered it
15,0.847439071,0,slowest laptop i have seen in last years out of the box
25,0.847812273,0,i am an international student and i had exams last week
15,0.999643353,0,i expect this machine to last me to years so im looking forward to next gen programs
39,0.995500517,0,i understand the reason it drives up cost but to me having an ssd in this system would make it even faster and make the battery last longer
39,0.999999136,0,we got this for my mom she wanted a tablet but there are non that have a usb port so we got her this the keyboard has a usb port and i also got her a converter for her memory chip for her camera now she can surf the net and look at her pictures and do all she needs and wants on the internet
25,0.999999946,0,next morning i contacted asus and was told that the subwoofer was not covered under the warranty for physical damage
15,0.451544637,0,just hoping that it would last a few years
9,0.287525699,0,installed windows in less about minutes
25,0.999999995,1,the asus customer folks told me it would be to repair the laptop after the first failure and same cost just for the boot disc when i could have bought a refurbished entire laptop for the same price so i went with the local tech
0,0.999740466,0,also the keyboard feels hollow when you type on it like you are going to push into the chassis of the notebook
8,0.661305421,0,does everything a regular computer can
15,0.999199769,0,this is the fourth laptop same make and model weve purchased in our family
15,0.99921179,0,a year and a half later i bought the version of the macbook pro
0,0.992854302,0,i decided not to get the touch screen because of the glare and smudges i had to deal with with my last laptop
15,0.999550176,0,i didnt order in my name but it was ordered in the same last name for me
15,0.999499375,0,i bought this computer last year for my husband
15,0.85492493,0,this would be my last acer product
17,0.945377819,0,i am in the process of sending the computer back a third time for the very same problem
0,0.998644141,0,i was taken to the same screen multiple times that read something like we are setting things up for you
4,0.999691614,0,but man all of the features i paid over g for before i now have for less than plus i get bluetooth and a touchscreen
14,0.997784563,1,it would be nice if the hdmi port was a full sized one
15,0.999432789,0,i was considering a macbook macbook air and macbook pro but i didnt want to pay an arm a few toes and a lot of money for an apple product that does the same thing or even has less specs than the asus zenbook
39,0.999955152,1,it would be nice if the keyboard was backlit but i understand thats asking too much of a computer for the gb model which i highly recommend for only about more than the model with half the memory
33,0.999852323,1,it would be helpful to have another computer or tablet so you can look at manual and google questions
18,1,1,in short and answering most of doubts that tapeworm before buying it they would be if to bring before wifi like everything portable one at present the controler or integrated it is of mark realtek hence it always goes to have support since this manufacturer of integrated performs the best thing for software or support of software if for x or y reason hp does not give any more in version later of windows or thinking to future with an excellent sign reception i have it on a second floor enough distance from which the modem is and without problems it manages the sign if to bring reading unit of dvd and quemadora of dvd not to bring bluray since the price is just and works perfectly if it brings to mount more memory ram at present it has a module gb ddr or mhz of mark hyundai in the integrated ones lets say that alone good behaves that for the processor and configuration of bios and card mother covers the module to mhz if to bring webcam and is relatively good for the price that is paid
30,0.999999863,0,i kept testing out the laptop to try and figure out what was up and in the process i got several bsods and the battery strangely went from to while the laptop was just sitting on my desk for a couple of hours
23,0.360562708,0,i had this computer for less than four hours and its already blue screened i am furious
32,0.999999479,0,i bought this laptop not from amazon as it my previous lenovo yoga flex screen would go blank and flicker again and again
39,1,1,note i had never upgraded this laptop to an ssd so i can not comment there i did not use the speakers a whole lot since i was in a location where headphones would be better suited though with my sonys which in large part is a to the headphones the sound was great the overall matte look is something i really liked too access to the bottom is something i loved too remove two basic phillips head screws and you can easily access the hdd ram and even the fan which if you needed to take it out and clean it or replace it looks like it would be a peace of cake this doesnt apply to all people but i have not had a single issue with any linux distribution i had thrown at it overall every single one worked flawlessly with this laptop once i made a few bios changes like turning off secure boot
0,0.999862988,0,the touchscreen has no useful gestures which is not really asus fault its just like damn nobody thought of useful ways to use this thing
7,0.999641951,0,ive had the battery last for hours some periods without wi fi on
17,0.758384418,0,when i got the computer back after weeks it still has the same problem
15,0.984112097,0,im looking forward to seeing what happens over the next few years
15,0.99999263,0,i bought a surface pro with them last year and went back for a dell xps i version
8,0.504195051,0,i use videoconferencing regularly for work and i have to borrow another computer to do it now
17,0.999939117,0,october technician came to my house with the motherboard took it apart to find out that dell did not include the proper heatsink she put the case back on in a rush and left
25,0.996606753,0,seeing as to how my blade is now outside the year warranty i think i am stuck living with this issue
9,0.999088428,0,i was installing multiple programs at the same time and man must i say the thing ran like a champ
15,0.986427735,0,unclear of what needs to be done we bought it less than year ago
0,0.999529339,1,one item i wish it had was back lit keys for typing in the dark but you can not have it all for a machine that costs
39,0.99957243,0,if you dont mind spending the cost of the drive and you find one that is mm or less in thickness you could replace the drive by removing the bottom screws on this laptop
4,0.375800446,0,for the price less than its a winner
25,0.999999991,0,eta it would cost to repair the cracked lcd screen its not cracked on the outside so something must have cracked on the inside
17,0.999999993,0,as you read the support pages you see how several customers actually did send their laptops probably out of the return period to the service center and had screens and motherboards replaced
9,0.999822803,0,i cant believe ive put up with regular disk drives all this time
9,0.979997572,0,i regularly use the usb port with a gb usb flash drive where i store music and files i need and it works well
30,0.554241092,0,so now my system is in fact touch less now
25,0.998814173,0,lastly i know some others had confusion about whether it was an i or i i bought the i because of the price difference
15,0.911405868,0,i have had two chromebooks over the last few years
2,0.999997596,0,lastly anything i want to save to a local drive i just save to a memory stick
15,0.947304876,0,i am no computer expert but my last laptop was an acer
17,0.9973841,0,it could scoot back and forth in the practically unpadded inner computer box in four directions seven or eight inches
9,0.999256588,0,i had the gb model though and i did notice lag regularly with its rockchip processor
39,0.98819329,1,i think the build is good but i wish the actual computer performance was also as good
17,0.714554722,0,replacement computer second shipment did the same thing returned it
23,0.964330076,0,the device battery gets charged in less than two hours and lasts approx
14,0.999999221,0,this may be caused by charging over usb c instead of the regular ac port
23,0.983256187,0,and now that ive had it for months the battery which used to last almost hours now barely lasts
15,0.996686336,0,the last dell they had lasted for almost years
17,0.999999949,0,they never inform you of the repair status the website warranty repair check in doesnt work so you have to go through asian foreign phone reps
28,0.883779273,0,purchased a samsung chromebook xec kus gb ram gb ssd that was less than the asus
17,1,0,have had problem with computer failing to start up properly have contacted dell support who now state there is a day warranty and i should ship the computer back to them to look it over
27,0.998788802,0,this item is at the big red circle store through september that is a steal
23,0.953771342,0,the battery by the way last for hours
33,0.998961346,1,most importantly for me when you place a p screen on the computer it would be nice to be able to play p videos without stuttering which this laptop is unable to do
17,0.965264544,0,trust me i tried calling the us service number and they wouldnt even talk to me once i told them i lived outside the us
8,0.999999986,0,even if you check keep logged in on your regular chrome account youll have to login every time here
0,0.999989994,0,and i just have not encountered the issues i have regularly with windows updates that dont work or take forever to load frozen screen shut downs you name it you know what i am talking about if you have ever owned a windows computer
15,0.999930289,0,i purchased this for school because i am in my last year and my microsoft expired
4,0.936245495,0,and do not buy it at the big computer store with the yellow sign
23,0.812928744,0,the battery doesnt last up to hours as stated
4,0.999999968,0,i purchased this item on promotion for but id think its worth the standard i see it listed for on amazon
13,0.999999938,1,i knew that coming in but i think it would be nice to know whole process took place in vaio japan
15,0.754489935,0,died in less than a year
21,0.999999999,1,when i bought it i didnt realize just how annoying it would be to have to have to use the function key and the arrow keys every time i wanted to change the volume
39,0.950830862,0,i like the hdmi output really useful for watching something on a big screen
25,0.999859415,0,there are no signs of physical damage to either the back of the screen or the front of the screen but samsung says the screen is physically damage
7,0.999993404,0,since i was outside and away from a wireless signal i turned off the wi fi at this time
32,0.993924247,0,it turns out that the os load was faulty resulting in the blue screen of death several times a day
30,0.977800761,0,upton turning it on it been loading software for last two hour
2,0.999489782,0,and the way google drive is set up when you save its seamless and identical to saving on a local drive
16,0.999975551,0,used it no issues screen closed opened back up minutes later and not so much as a drop of life in this thing
17,0.822015995,0,understand though that my last computer was a dell dimension
25,0.704081882,0,i also have had the computer for less than a year and am having charging issues
8,0.990788684,0,i decided on the pro version over the regular model because of the longer warranty
39,0.988873198,0,the matte screen makes reading and otherwise using the device outside easier as it reduces screen glare
25,0.999491432,0,the laptop did not last even an year and when i went to get repaired the power supply ic was gone
35,1,0,it functions but i have to pound on the keys and spacebar computer can barely handle microsoft visual studio for beginning coding classes yet it meets the minimum requirements set by my instructor and school i tried gaming on this wildstar and kingdom hearts i think dont try unless you have patience
8,0.989882911,0,the second shows the disparity in text sizes between a shortcut on the desktop and the text in the same program
23,0.999999732,0,so the battery life for me streaming youtube videos at p connected to an external pfps monitor and browsing brightness on the internal screen is hrs
39,0.998459217,0,i had a lower tier acer for years and needed to upgrade i settled on this one as it met all my predicted needs and my previous acer really left nothing to be desired
0,0.994053344,0,every time your kid touches the outer screen your mouse will move to his screen and you have to drag it back into your screen
0,0.512203083,0,comacer chromebook heatsink cooler shen dpbqkvarefsrutfqidsr keywordsacercchromebookfanthe part cost went in with no problems in less than minutes
17,0.999842467,0,overall though i did fix the issue within a few hours and residual software problems have diminished over the last week or so as microsoft continues to issue updates
3,0.999999738,0,took less than five minutes to install and then just had to turn on the platform trust setting and enable the password in the bios
23,0.983570448,0,computer is freezing last night froze on my son doing homework
9,0.601551606,0,product was missing gb ssd
17,0.999753196,0,either way i did not pay for a defective item and sent the thing back the following day
15,0.356052048,0,the d was the last latitude model dell produced with a serial port in the back
25,0.979475851,0,also come with a warranty that last through oct
15,0.939731676,0,months later my daughter turns on her chromebook and it says something about a portion of chrome os is missing
16,0.966159172,0,i had to tune the screen before the problems became less noticeable
23,0.996590265,0,lastly the battery lasts about hours before needing recharging
39,0.999999981,1,if i had to complain about something it would be that the battery runs out quickly but i tend to keep it plugged in anyway and even though the volume is good it could have been better but overall i would recommend this laptop
23,0.968070104,0,barely last hours while streaming online videos
39,0.999359771,1,it would be better to have a macintosh monitor for the high resolution to match the high resolution in the kirabook
39,0.99923332,0,the plastic parts feel a bit looks and one of the plastic legs on the bottom is missing
15,0.999951762,0,i bought the gb model but since my last one was almost maxed out i wish id bought the gb one
39,0.999599925,1,as i have had some bad experience with such combos it would be nice to have a bluetooth combo delivered or at least tested and certified by dell

4,0.991126304,0,overall it is a laptop worth the price
25,0.999998413,0,the photo is what mine looks like because of samsung not covering the warranty the screws missing are replaced with bolts and thats not even working because the plastics starting to crack around the bolts
15,0.925829588,0,just beware this is a one year or less item
4,1,0,i think given the overall benefits of a mac system this isnt a big deal at all but then again i think apples unwillingness to publish a substantial guide to its products basically is the reason why windows is still even a competitor for apple and people still are attached to pcs

30,0.99999996,0,i purchased this computer a few months ago and as soon as my warranty ended to send it back the computer decided that the usb port would no longer work
25,0.999998168,0,the laptop was already tampered with because it was missing a screw but there is a warranty but the company still wants to put the charger port back inside which looked as if it was glued on
